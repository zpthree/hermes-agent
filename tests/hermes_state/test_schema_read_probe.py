"""Contract tests for schema_read_probe_statements().

Read-only SessionDB opens skip _reconcile_columns() by design, so dashboard
read paths heal stale stores via a probe-then-writable-reopen dance in
``hermes_cli.web_server_sessions._open_session_db_at_path``. These tests pin the
probe's contract: it is DERIVED from SCHEMA_SQL (any column added there is
covered automatically — the previous hand-written probe went stale within
days) and it must fail at prepare time on a store missing any declared
column or table.
