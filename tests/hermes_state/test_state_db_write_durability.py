"""Regression: state.db repair-path writes must be durable on macOS.

Incident (2026-08-19, recurrence of 2026-08-18/19): `state.db` was recovered
clean at 01:02, tore again in the pages holding rows written 02:18-02:22, and
the damage went undetected until 13:36 when a write finally landed on a
damaged page (`append_message failed: constraint failed`). `PRAGMA
integrity_check` on the file reported the torn-b-tree signature:

    Tree 5 page 47256 cell 423..429: 2nd reference to page ...
    Tree 5 page 60788 cell 4: Rowid 34637 out of order
    Page 50549..52587: never used

The defect: hermes_state already knows macOS `fsync()` does not guarantee
write ordering, and mitigates it with `synchronous=FULL` +
`checkpoint_fullfsync=1` (see `_enforce_macos_synchronous_full`, whose
docstring names this exact failure: "a WAL checkpoint race with process
termination ... can leave the main DB with half-written btree pages").
Those pragmas are per-connection and were applied only via
`apply_wal_with_fallback()`. The repair path opened `state.db` with a bare
`sqlite3.connect()` five times and then ran REINDEX, VACUUM and
`writable_schema` surgery through it — the operations that rewrite nearly
every page of the file — with no barrier at all.

(The proactive `verify_state_db_integrity()` gate the original PR #90747 also
carried is deferred to the follow-up that wires it into gateway startup —
PR #91754 — since it ships as dead code without that caller. This file covers
only the repair-connection durability half.)
