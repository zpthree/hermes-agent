"""Tests for SessionDB WAL checkpoint strategy (issue #45383).

Verifies that ALL checkpoints on the shared state.db use PASSIVE mode:
periodic, close(), and pre-VACUUM. TRUNCATE fires a full WAL reset, and
transient per-cron-run connections closing many times an hour would race
the live gateway writer and corrupt B-tree pages (#45383).
