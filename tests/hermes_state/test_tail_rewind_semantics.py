"""Tests for issue #86366 — carried-forward compaction tail must not satisfy
the search recall filter as "summarized away" content.

``archive_and_compact()`` soft-archives every active row with
``compacted = 1`` and then re-inserts ``compacted_messages`` as fresh live
rows. When the compressor's protected tail rides inside that list verbatim,
its ORIGINALS end up stored twice: ``(active=0, compacted=1)`` next to the
live clone — and since ``search_messages()`` recalls both flags, every
carried-forward message came back once per compaction, mislabeled as
archived history.

The fix adds a ``tail_count`` parameter: the last *tail_count* archived rows
are superseded byte-identical duplicates (rewind semantics:
``active=0, compacted=0``, hidden from recall) instead of compacted history.
Callers without tail knowledge keep the archive-everything behavior.

Pinned here at the persistence layer:

* ``tail_count > 0`` → tail originals hidden from ``search_messages``,
  non-tail originals still recalled;
* default (``tail_count=0``) → historical behavior unchanged;
* live-context load and counters unaffected by the new split.

And at the compressor boundary:

* batch ``compress()`` tags its carried-forward tail dicts so the caller can
  count them for the commit.
