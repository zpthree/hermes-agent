"""Tests for the concurrent authorization gate and human-wait accounting (#79719).

Before the fix, a worker wedged *inside* the authorization gate — a hanging
``pre_tool_call`` plugin, or an approval round-trip to a client that went
away — had two coupled failure modes:

1. The serialization lock was an unbounded blocking acquire: every other
   worker needing authorization blocked behind the wedged holder forever.
2. ``excluded_seconds()`` measured residency in ``gate.run()`` (arbitrary
   code), so an open window grew 1:1 with wall clock while the batch-deadline
   loop added it to the deadline on every poll — ``remaining`` was constant
   and the deadline NEVER fired. Algebraically:
   ``remaining = (deadline + (now - window_started)) - now = deadline - window_started``.

The fix moves deadline exclusion to the source of the human wait
(``tools.approval_human_wait.human_wait_window`` around the CLI prompt and the gateway
approval poll loop) and bounds the serialization lock acquire. A wedged
plugin now contributes nothing to the exclusion, so the batch times out
normally; a genuine approval wait is still excluded in full.
