"""Thread-safety of the deferred single-use-token refresh path (#71775).

The deferred path deliberately runs OAuth network I/O outside the pool
lock. These tests pin the two invariants that make that safe:

1. `select()` does NOT hold the pool lock while the deferred refresh's
   network call runs (the whole point of the PR).
2. The pool mutations that follow the network call (`_replace_entry`,
   `_persist`) DO re-serialize under the pool lock, so a concurrent
   `select()`/rotation cannot tear `self._entries` or double-write
   auth.json.
