"""Send-path transforms must never write through into persisted history.

The send path builds ``api_messages`` from the persisted conversation
history and then rewrites the copies IN PLACE (tool-call argument
canonicalization/repair, surrogate sanitization, non-ASCII sanitization,
content strips). The build previously used a shallow ``msg.copy()``, which
decouples only top-level fields: nested containers (tool_calls entries and
their function dicts, multimodal content-part lists, reasoning_details)
stayed aliased to the history's objects, so those in-place transforms
silently rewrote the stored transcript. Incident #80498: an unrepairable
``write_file`` argument string was replaced with ``{}`` in the persisted
turn, destroying the streamed file content.

``_clone_message_for_send`` closes the whole class at the chokepoint: it
clones every container while sharing immutable leaves. These tests pin the
invariant CLASS-WIDE — every send-path in-place transform runs over an
adversarial fixture and the history must remain byte-identical — so any
future transform added to the pipeline inherits the guarantee (or fails
here loudly).
