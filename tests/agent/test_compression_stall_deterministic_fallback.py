"""A repeated summary stall escalates to the deterministic fallback summary — #112420.

After one stall the host records a stall-class backoff (``_consecutive_timeout_failures`` >= 1). When the
next attempt stalls again, "continuing without compression" would re-enter the same silent route every
turn, so the stall retry ladder ends with a deterministic rung: the worker is re-run with the summary LLM
skipped and compress() commits its static fallback summary through the ordinary lease/fence pipeline.
A first stall keeps today's behaviour (backoff, LLM retry after it lapses) unless the request is already
above the model's context window — then nothing can be sent unchanged and the rung runs at once (#114594). A pinned fallback route whose
summary call fails still commits under the default ``abort_on_summary_failure=false`` — that must not be
logged as a recovery (#112387 review caveat).
