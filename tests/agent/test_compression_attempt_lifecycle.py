"""Attempt-lifecycle regression tests for #97488 / #96775.

Pins the three attempt-level lifecycle guarantees added after PR #98628
collapsed lean compaction to one auxiliary request per attempt:

1. A ceiling/idle-timeout host TEARS DOWN its worker: a cooperative worker is
   joined within the bounded grace (releasing the lease normally), while an
   uninterruptible worker is orphaned behind the poison fence — its late
   result is discarded and, on the total-ceiling path, the durable lease is
   retained until it exits so no new attempt overlaps the unchanged session.
2. A failed/stalled/cancelled attempt records a durable per-session backoff
   (strategy + failure kind stamped into the state.db cooldown row) that
   SURVIVES a gateway restart; the next automatic turn skips the same
   strategy inside the window, and a successful compression clears it.
3. Late results from a superseded attempt are discarded, never committed
   over newer state (generation counter), and a transiently-blocked no-op is
   reported as a soft defer — never compression_exhausted (false auto-reset).
