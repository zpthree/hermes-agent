"""Tests for the concurrent start-order gate (PR #79571 / issue #79569).

The gate serializes tool dispatch by submit order so approval prompts and
progress output appear in the order the model requested them. A tool that
wedges *during dispatch* must not park every later-ordered worker forever:
before the bound existed, those parked tools never started, the batch deadline
then falsely reported them as "timed out", and the parked threads leaked
permanently (``f.cancel()`` cannot stop a running thread and nothing ever
notified the condition again).
