"""A successful compaction hands allocator pages back to the OS.

The compressed-away message dicts are the largest allocation a long session
ever frees, but Python's arena allocator keeps those pages in the process heap
— RSS retains the pre-compaction high-water mark until exit. #76905's
trim_memory lifecycle covers the gateway/TUI housekeeping loops but not the
CLI compression path, so compress() now calls
``trim_memory(reason="post-compression")`` after a successful pass.

trim_memory itself is glibc/Linux-gated (a fast no-op on macOS), so these
tests monkeypatch the seam rather than asserting on RSS. Salvaged in spirit
from #70782 (which reached for a bare gc.collect(); trim_memory is the
house mechanism and already wraps a collect).
