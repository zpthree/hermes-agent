"""acquire_lease must re-select after a deferred single-use-token refresh.

Post-merge gate-sweep finding on the #71775 salvage (deferred refresh moved
OUTSIDE the pool lock). ``select()`` re-selects once the refreshed entries
are back in rotation (credential_pool.py, select() -> "if pending_refresh:
re-select"); ``acquire_lease()`` did not, so a pool whose only entries all
needed a refresh returned None even though the refresh had just succeeded —
the caller saw "no credentials available" and failed a request that should
have gone through.

These tests stub ``_available_entries`` / ``_refresh_pending_entries`` at the
same seam the production deferred-refresh contract uses: _available_entries
returns ``(available, pending_refresh)`` and entries pending a refresh are
NOT in ``available`` until the refresh has run.
