"""Regression tests for the /api/status profile-topology cache.

The desktop app polls /api/status ~1/s while waiting for the backend to become
ready. Before the cache, every poll ran a full _collect_profile_gateway_topology
scan (per-profile yaml.safe_load with the pure-Python loader + psutil
process-table probes + realpath walks) in the default executor; on multi-profile
installs the concurrent scans held the GIL for 14-16s and starved the event
loop, so the desktop WS never received gateway.ready and boot escalated to the
"Hermes couldn't start" overlay (#60800).
