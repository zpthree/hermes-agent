"""Regression tests for #48820 (4th repro): job-object teardown killed the
post-update respawned gateway silently, and the updater printed
"✓ Restarting Windows gateway profile(s)" anyway.

Two fixes under test:

1. ``_spawn_gateway_restart_watcher``'s inlined watcher source must
   (a) route the respawned gateway's stray stdout/stderr to
       ``logs/gateway-stdio.log`` (it was ``DEVNULL`` — a gateway killed by
       parent Job Object teardown left ZERO trace anywhere), and
   (b) stamp ``_HERMES_GATEWAY_BREAKAWAY`` =1/0 on the respawn env exactly
       like the canonical ``gateway_windows._spawn_detached``, so the
       lifecycle/exit-diag records show whether the gateway escaped the
       parent's Job Object.

2. ``_resume_windows_gateways_after_update`` must verify a stable gateway
   process actually exists (via ``gateway_windows._wait_for_gateway_ready``)
   before printing the ✓ — a truthy launch return only proves the watcher
   process was created, not that the respawned gateway survived the
   updater's Job Object teardown.
