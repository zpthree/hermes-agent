"""Regression: a composed (NFC) workspace path must resolve against its repo root.

macOS hands back DECOMPOSED path strings (NFD: ``o`` + U+0308) for names the user
typed in composed form (NFC: ``ö``). A OneDrive/FileProvider root such as
``OneDrive-Persönlich`` therefore arrives from ``git rev-parse --show-toplevel``
as NFD while the kanban DB row holds NFC. The raw ``Path`` comparisons in
``_resolve_worktree_workspace`` / ``_ensure_git_worktree`` /
``_cleanup_worktree_workspace`` then reported a real repo root as "not inside a
git repo" and dispatch died with a ``ValueError`` for every task on that board.

The identity comparison goes through ``_path_key`` (NFC-normalized), so Unicode
form can never decide a path identity question again.
