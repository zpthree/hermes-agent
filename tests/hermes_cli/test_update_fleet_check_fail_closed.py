"""Regression for #93406 — post-update fleet version check must fail closed.

``collect_fleet_versions()`` swallows every probe failure via
``logger.debug()`` and ``print_fleet_version_matrix([])`` early-returns
``False``, so an empty fleet snapshot used to read as "healthy fleet" and
``hermes update`` exited 0 with zero rows — even when a gateway was
verifiably live before the update.

The first guard (PR #93410) keyed on ``(restarted_services or killed_pids)``,
which never fires on Windows: ``_pause_windows_gateways_for_update`` /
``_resume_windows_gateways_after_update`` populate neither list.  The fix
hoists the "should the probe have produced rows?" decision into
``_fleet_probe_expected_runtimes`` and keys it on the ROW-CAPABLE pre-update
liveness signals: restart-phase bookkeeping, the pre-restart PID snapshot,
and the gateway-kind records in the pre-update plan inventory (the plan's
serve/dashboard records are row-incapable for this probe, #97332).  The
Windows pause/resume token is deliberately NOT a signal — it is bookkeeping,
not a runtime inventory, and its entries have no corresponding
``collect_fleet_versions()`` rows (see
``test_update_fleet_probe_resume_token.py``).  The same condition gates the
2.0s settle sleep.
