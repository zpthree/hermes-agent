"""Tests for the /model picker background cache prewarm.

``prewarm_picker_cache_async()`` warms the provider-models disk cache off the
user's critical path so the first ``/model`` open in a session is fast instead
of blocking ~1-2s on serial /v1/models fetches. These pin the two contracts
that matter: it runs the warm path exactly once per process (no thread leak),
and it delegates to ``list_authenticated_providers`` to do the warming.

    """End-to-end regression for #72762: the active custom endpoint must be
    warm by the time the user opens ``/model``, not just first-class
    ``PROVIDER_REGISTRY`` providers.

    The cache is keyed purely on ``base_url`` (see ``cached_fetch_api_models``
    in ``hermes_cli/models.py``), so this is not specific to any named
    provider — the fixture below stands in for any OpenAI-compatible custom
    endpoint a user might configure (an LLM gateway, Kilo Code, Together AI,
    a self-hosted vLLM/SGLang server, ...).

    Runs the real ``list_authenticated_providers()`` (not mocked, unlike the
    two tests above) through the prewarm thread against a fake
    ``load_picker_context()`` config with one active custom provider, then
    replays the exact kwargs the plain CLI ``/model`` handler passes twice in
    a row (``probe_custom_providers=False, probe_current_custom_provider=True``),
    simulating two ``/model`` opens in one session.

    We deliberately do NOT assert on *which* of (prewarm thread, first
    foreground open) wins the race to perform the live fetch — that's a
    thread-scheduling detail, not the contract. What must hold regardless of
    scheduling: across the warm-up plus two foreground opens, the endpoint is
    ever probed live at most once, and every open after that first probe is
    served from the disk cache with zero additional network calls.
