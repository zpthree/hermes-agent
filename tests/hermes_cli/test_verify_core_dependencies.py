"""Tests for _verify_core_dependencies_installed.

Regression coverage for the partial-install bug where uv's incremental
resolver silently failed to land ``pathspec`` (and similar newly-added
base deps) during ``hermes update``, leaving the venv in a broken state
that only surfaced hours later when a downstream subprocess imported the
missing module.

The verification step:
  1. Reads pyproject.toml's [project.dependencies] directly.
  2. Filters by environment markers so cross-platform exclusions don't
     false-positive (e.g. ``ptyprocess ; sys_platform != 'win32'`` on Windows).
  3. Probes ``importlib.metadata.version()`` in the venv interpreter.
  4. Reinstalls with --reinstall, then per-package, if anything's missing.
