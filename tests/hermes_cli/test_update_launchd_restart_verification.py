"""Regression for #88848 - a launchd restart the update never verified.

``hermes update`` on macOS printed ``Update complete!`` and exited 0 while the
``ai.hermes.gateway`` LaunchAgent sat deregistered for 36 minutes.  The restart
phase treated "``launchd_restart()`` returned without raising" as success and
appended the label to ``restarted_services``.  Both of launchd_restart's normal
outcomes are asynchronous - the ``_request_gateway_self_restart`` branch returns
the instant the running gateway is *asked* to restart, and a plist reload is
handed to a detached helper - so a helper that died before its first bootstrap
was invisible to the caller.

The systemd branch of the same phase has never drawn that inference: it polls
``_wait_for_service_active`` before recording the unit and routes a unit that
never came back into ``failed_or_stale_units``, which is what makes the update
exit non-zero.  These tests pin the same contract for launchd.

No macOS hardware is involved: every case drives the seam through mocked
``launchctl`` outcomes.
