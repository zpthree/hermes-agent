"""Invariant: importing a backup must not publish a NEW state.db inode while a
live process still holds the deleted one (#110179).

``_import_db_member`` guards the replace path with ``_safe_restore_db``, but the
"target is missing" branch treated absence as proof of no holders. A gateway that
had the database open when it was unlinked keeps writing the deleted inode, so an
atomic publish there re-creates exactly the #90950 split brain the branch below
avoids. The holder here is a real subprocess with a real SQLite connection.
