"""Host-specific gating in ``hermes_cli.gateway._all_platforms()``.

Some messaging platforms can't function on every host. The gate lives
in one place — ``_all_platforms()`` — so the setup wizard, the curses
gateway-config menu, and any future picker all see the same filtered
list.

Currently:
- Matrix is hidden on Windows. The ``[matrix]`` extra pulls
  ``mautrix[encryption]`` -> ``python-olm``, which has no Windows wheel
  and needs ``make`` + libolm to build from sdist. There's no native
  Windows path that works.
