# ---- prompt_toolkit / capsys isolation ----
# ``cli._cprint`` renders through ``prompt_toolkit.print_formatted_text``,
# which — when called with no explicit ``output=`` — lazily creates an
# ``Output`` from ``sys.stdout`` **and caches it on the process-global default
# ``AppSession``** (``prompt_toolkit.application.current._current_app_session``,
# a ``ContextVar`` with a module-level default). The cache is keyed to nothing
# and never re-reads ``sys.stdout``.
#
# Under pytest, ``capsys`` swaps ``sys.stdout`` for a fresh buffer per test.
# So the first CLI test that emits through ``_cprint`` (e.g. one exercising
# ``/queue``, which prints a "Queued: …" line) locks prompt_toolkit's cached
# output onto *its* captured stdout. Every later ``capsys`` test that asserts
# on ``_cprint`` output then reads an empty buffer, because the render went to
# the first test's now-dead capture target. That is the mechanism behind the
# order-dependent ``test_resume_quiet_stderr`` failure: it passes in isolation
# and in its own file, but fails in a full ``tests/cli`` run.
#
# Reset the cached output before every CLI test so each one re-creates a fresh
# prompt_toolkit ``Output`` bound to its own ``sys.stdout`` on first use. This
# is a no-op when prompt_toolkit isn't importable and cheap otherwise (the
# property re-creates lazily).
