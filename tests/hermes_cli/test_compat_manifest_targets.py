"""Plugin-compat pointers must resolve to the SAME object the name moved to, never a same-named stranger.

Regression: ``hermes_cli.kanban_db.connect`` was pointed at ``hermes_cli.projects_db.connect`` (a different
database, no ``board=`` parameter) because the generator ranked candidate homes by path proximity. The
manifest codified the mistake, so the compat lint treated it as valid.

Invariant checked here: for every ``moved-lazy`` entry whose target module also exists in the manifest of
some other facade under the same name, or whose facade stem has a sibling ``<stem>_*`` module defining the
name, the facade attribute IS the sibling's object.
