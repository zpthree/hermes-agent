"""Merge-order-safe expected failures for live gaps whose fix is an open PR.

A plain ``xfail(strict=True)`` turns main red the moment its fix merges (XPASS), and a
non-strict one guards nothing. Instead, each gap here has a PROBE: a few lines that reproduce
the defect's mechanism on the tree under test, in a throwaway interpreter with its own
``HOME``/``HERMES_HOME`` (no state leaks into the suite process). ``expect_gap`` applies a
strict xfail only while the probe still reproduces the defect; once the fix is in the tree the
cell runs as a plain test, so it must pass. Whichever lands first, suite or fix, main stays
green, and a probe that disagrees with the end-to-end cell still fails loudly (XPASS, or a
real failure) instead of hiding.

Probes exercise behaviour only (never read source text). When a fix has landed, delete its
entry and every ``expect_gap`` / ``gap_open`` call naming it.

A gap with no fix PR yet has no probe: ``known_failure`` is a run-time xfail keyed on the gap's
own assertion message, so the cell XFAILs only while it fails exactly that way, fails loudly on
any other failure, and simply passes once someone fixes the gap.
