"""Entrypoint parity matrix (issue classes C19 + C15).

One fixture HERMES_HOME (shell hook + plugin hook on ``pre_llm_call``, AGENTS.md,
a skill, a memory entry, a stdio MCP server that spawns a grandchild, the custom
provider pointed at the recording fake, a disabled toolset) and ONE scripted turn
per entrypoint: the fake model calls the MCP canary tool, then answers.

For every entrypoint the same invariants must hold on the FIRST turn after a cold
start — any red cell is a wiring-parity bug of the "works in the CLI, missing in
Desktop/gateway/ACP/cron" class:

* the request carries the context file, the skill index and the memory entry;
* both hooks fired AND their injected context reached the model;
* the MCP tool was offered and a REAL call returned the fixture's canary (the
  inverted ``_stdio_children_dead`` burst failed exactly here on every surface);
* the documented toolset's core feature tools are present, the disabled toolset
  is absent;
* the surface delivered the model's answer to its client;
* after the surface's normal shutdown no MCP server / grandchild survives.

``PARITY_TABLE_OUT=<path>`` appends a markdown row per entrypoint (REPORT.md table).
