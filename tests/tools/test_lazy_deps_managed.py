"""Managed-install guard in :func:`tools.lazy_deps.ensure` (#48628).

A package-manager install (NixOS, and anything else shipping Hermes from a
read-only store) cannot receive lazy pip installs: the venv's site-packages
lives in the store, so the uv -> pip -> ensurepip ladder burns ~15s
bootstrapping ensurepip only to fail. ``ensure()`` must fail fast instead.
