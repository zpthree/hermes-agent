"""Honesty of the manual-run delivery notice (issue #83993).

A manual ``cronjob(action='run')`` finishes with a completion summary line

    Delivery target: <target> (output was delivered there by the job itself)

that was appended UNCONDITIONALLY for non-local targets — even when
``run_one_job`` had just written ``last_delivery_error`` onto the refreshed
job record because the post-run delivery (telegram/discord/…) failed. The
calling agent then relayed "all good" over a failed delivery.

The note must follow the refreshed job record: a set ``last_delivery_error``
means delivery FAILED with the error text surfaced; an empty/missing error
keeps the legacy wording byte-for-byte (zero regression), and local jobs
always say saved-locally.

    The dispatch tests below submit real workers onto the process-wide
    daemon executor in ``tools.async_delegation``. A finished worker parks
    idle holding an ``_idle_semaphore`` token, so the NEXT dispatch in this
    process REUSES that thread instead of spawning a fresh one — and only
    the fresh-spawn path keeps upstream's dispatch-and-return test winning
    its patch-visibility race: ``Thread.start()`` blocks the dispatching
    thread until the worker has bootstrapped, so the worker performs
    ``_run_claimed_job``'s lazy ``from cron.scheduler import run_one_job``
    while the test's patches are still active. On the idle-reuse path
    ``submit`` returns with the GIL still held, the patch block unwinds
    first, and the worker binds the REAL ``run_one_job`` — which then runs
    the fake job for real ("no model configured") and the mock never fires.

    ``test_dispatches_and_returns_handle_immediately`` fails
