"""``delegation.child_timeout_seconds`` bounds INACTIVITY, not total runtime (#116001).

A configured cap used to be a dispatch-to-death stopwatch: every child that ran longer than the budget was
abandoned even while the provider was actively serving it. Measured over 219 tasks / 75 deaths, 0 of 75 deaths
happened mid-tool — all of them were waiting on an in-flight LLM completion, so the cap converted transient
provider slowness into lost work (a nearly-finished context discarded every time).

These tests pin both directions of the fix:
- a child whose activity signals keep advancing outlives a cap far shorter than its runtime;
- a child with no progress at all is still abandoned when the cap elapses (the knob keeps its teeth).
