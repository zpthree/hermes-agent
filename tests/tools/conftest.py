"""Shared fixtures for tests/tools/ web-provider tests.

Per-file subprocess isolation means each test file gets a fresh interpreter,
so module-level state (like the web-search-provider registry) is empty when
a file starts.  The ``web_registry_populated`` fixture registers all bundled
providers before each test and resets the registry afterwards — tests that
depend on the registry being populated should use it explicitly or via
``@pytest.mark.usefixtures("web_registry_populated")``.
