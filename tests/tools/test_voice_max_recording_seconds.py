"""Regression test: voice.max_recording_seconds is actually enforced.

Before this fix, ``voice.max_recording_seconds`` was defined in the default
config (hermes_cli/config.py) and documented, but no code read it — the
AudioRecorder had no total-length cap, so the setting was dead config. This
test pins the enforcement contract on the recorder:

* cap disabled (0 / unset) → never auto-stops on duration (previous behaviour),
* cap set to N>0 → auto-stop condition becomes true once elapsed >= N.
