"""Accretion caps for _read_tracker (file_tools) and _completion_consumed
(process_registry).

Both structures are process-lifetime singletons that previously grew
unbounded in long-running CLI / gateway sessions:

  file_tools_read_tracking._read_tracker[task_id]
    ├─ read_history (set)      — one entry per unique (path, offset, limit)
    ├─ dedup (dict)            — one entry per unique (path, offset, limit)
    └─ read_timestamps (dict)  — one entry per unique resolved path
  process_registry._completion_consumed (set) — one entry per session_id
    ever polled / waited / logged

None of these were ever trimmed.  A 10k-read CLI session accumulated
roughly 1.5MB of tracker state; a gateway with high background-process
churn accumulated ~20B per session_id until the process exited.

These tests pin the new caps + prune hooks.
