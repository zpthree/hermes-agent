"""write_file tells the caller when it just re-sent a large file that was already on disk.

In one 1,393-agent run 661 read->whole-file-rewrites of >20k-char files cost ~25M output chars (~$155)
while `patch` (1.3k chars/call) succeeded 99.7% of the time; the tool result is the only place to say so.
