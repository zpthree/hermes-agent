"""Regression tests for MCP stdio aggregate liveness (#94335 / #94637).

The #81995 fast-fail gate consumes ``_stdio_children_dead`` as a boolean
state machine: True means every tracked child is gone; False means at least
one child is alive or liveness is unknown. The live-child branch was inverted,
so healthy stdio RPCs were cancelled while their subprocesses were still alive.

Watcher-consumer cases are distilled from #94521. Dependency/probe fail-open
cases are distilled from #94661 into the canonical #94339 carrier.
