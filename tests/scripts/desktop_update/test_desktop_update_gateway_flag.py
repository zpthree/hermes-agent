"""The hand-off's `--gateway` flag, exercised against the real posix script.

`hermes update --gateway` (re)starts the local messaging gateway after the
update. A Desktop served by a remote gateway (#117529) must not ask for that:
the restarted local gateway shares the remote host's channel credentials and
becomes a competing long-poll consumer — Telegram answers the conflict by
rejecting one of the two `getUpdates` callers, taking the production bot
offline. The Desktop therefore passes `--no-gateway` whenever its active
connection is remote-shaped; these tests pin both sides of that contract
against the real `posix.sh`, so neither the default (local ownership) nor the
opt-out can silently regress.
