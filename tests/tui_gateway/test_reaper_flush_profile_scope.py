"""The reaper/exit-flush transcript persistence: right home, no external-secret hydration.

``session_reaper._flush_session_messages`` runs on the reaper tick and on the exit-flush worker —
threads with no turn on the stack. The transcript ROWS were never at risk (a profile session gets a
dedicated ``SessionDB`` whose ``db_path`` is frozen at construction), but everything
``agent._persist_session`` resolves at CALL time — config.yaml, the token ledger, memory/provider
lookups — resolved against the LAUNCH profile for a served profile's flush. ``_finalize_session``
binds the same session at the same chokepoint.

Binding that scope must stay CHEAP: it happens inside a 5s total exit-flush budget, and hydrating
the profile's external secret sources shells out to the operator's secret command (30s CLI budget)
— persisting a transcript needs no external credential.
