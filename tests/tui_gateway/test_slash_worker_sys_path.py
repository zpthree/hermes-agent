"""Regression tests for tui_gateway/slash_worker.py sys.path hardening (issue #51286).

The slash-command worker is spawned as ``-m tui_gateway.slash_worker`` and
inherits the user's CWD. A local package (e.g. ``utils/``) in that CWD shadows
the installed hermes ``utils`` module and crashes the worker on ``import cli``
(``ImportError: cannot import name 'atomic_replace' from 'utils'``).

#51693 added this guard to the sibling entrypoints ``tui_gateway/entry.py`` and
``acp_adapter/entry.py`` (via the shared ``hermes_bootstrap.harden_import_path``
helper) but missed this child, so the crash still reproduced. slash_worker.py
must run the guard before its first non-stdlib import.
