"""Follow-up regressions for the 2026-08-09 relay delivery fixes (#82592).

Four review findings on the original branch:

1. HIGH — classifier/resolver mismatch: ``_classify_completion_target``
   returned "deliver" for idle-ended parents, but
   ``_resolve_async_delegation_session`` (untouched) still dropped every
   non-compression-ended pin. The durable row was acked at adapter
   acceptance, then the injection silently died inside the pipeline — a
   falsely-acknowledged permanent loss, strictly worse than the honest
   terminal drop on main. Fix: the resolver retargets non-user-boundary
   ends to the chat's current session; both sides share
   ``_USER_BOUNDARY_END_REASONS`` so they cannot drift again.

2. HIGH — the drain-grace clamp only budgeted drain + 3×teardown, but
   ``RelayAdapter.disconnect`` spends monitor-teardown + go_idle time
   BEFORE the transport drain inside the same runner wait_for. Fix: the
   adapter measures its own elapsed time and threads the REMAINING budget
   into ``transport.disconnect(budget_s=...)``.

3. P1 — a ``_request_response`` racing disconnect could register a future
   after the fail-pending loop and strand its caller for the full
   30s outbound timeout. Fix: fast-fail when ``_closing`` is set.

4. P1 — ``_build_process_event_source``'s last-resort reconstruction
   omitted ``scope_id``, so a scoped relay completion whose session-store
   origin was unavailable primed no scope discriminator and could still
   bounce off the connector's tenant guard. Fix: thread ``scope_id``
   through the reconstruction (and warn when it's absent for scoped chats).
