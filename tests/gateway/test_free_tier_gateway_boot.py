"""The messaging gateway is a boot owner of the Nous free tier.

Rung 5 made every demand-time site a read (provider resolution, ``/login``, the connector token), so a
process that never runs the bootstrap can never have an identity. `cmd_chat` and `hermes serve` run it;
this file pins that `hermes gateway run` does too, and does it BEFORE any adapter connects, so a fast
first DM cannot arrive with nothing to resolve.
