"""The gateway lifecycle verbs mean "the ONE host process", not "this profile's gateway".

Invariants, all against a REAL live process standing in for the owner:

* ATTACH requires a LIVE ``identify`` answer. A record on its own proves only that an owner
  exists — believing its ``profiles`` list parked a second profile's supervised unit against a
  served set that process had not committed to (and, with multiplex off, never would).
* ``--replace`` signals the owner instead of standing down.
* ``--force`` starts without asking the owner anything.
* The claim-time record carries NO served set; it is filled in once the channel answers.

The record is written as raw JSON, not via ``HostRecord(...)``, so these tests collect and RUN
against a tree without the ``home`` field and fail on the OUTCOME rather than on a TypeError.
