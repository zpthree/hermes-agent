"""A successful busy redirect re-anchors the running turn's reply to the redirecting message.

The turn's reply anchor and ledger identity are bound to the message that OPENED it and the
final send is bracketed against that event, so before this a redirected turn answered B while
its reply still quoted A (#115001, Repro A). Both redirect entry points — the interrupt-mode
busy path and the priority path — must move the anchor; a refused redirect must not.
