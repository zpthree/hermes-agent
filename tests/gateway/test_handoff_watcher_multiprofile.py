"""Handoff watcher must poll EVERY served profile's store, not just the root.

Regression guard for the multi-profile ``/handoff`` bug: ``/handoff`` writes
``handoff_state='pending'`` into the store of the profile the CLI ran under
(``hermes -p medicina``), while the gateway's watcher resolves ``_session_db``
from whatever HERMES_HOME is active on its task. Unscoped that is always the
ROOT store, so the pending row was never seen and the CLI timed out with the
gateway plainly alive and connected.

These tests pin the two halves of the fix:
  1. the scope list includes the root (``None``) plus every multiplexed home,
     and degrades to ``[None]`` for a single-profile gateway;
  2. the watcher actually enters ``_profile_runtime_scope`` for each non-root
     home, which is what re-points ``_session_db`` at that profile's store.
