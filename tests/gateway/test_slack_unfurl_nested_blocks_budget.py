"""Nested ``attachments[].blocks[]`` text in link unfurls shares one bounded budget.

The live inbound path (``_append_link_unfurls``) renders each attachment's Block Kit
``blocks`` into the message the agent reads. Slack allows up to 20 attachments per message,
each carrying its own blocks, so without a shared ceiling the projection grows linearly with
attachment count while the top-level ``blocks`` path is capped once.
