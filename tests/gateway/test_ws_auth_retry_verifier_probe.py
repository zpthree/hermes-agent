"""Adversarial verifier probes for the mattermost-ws-401-classify fix
(commit fdd1a11ac5).

The implementer's test_ws_auth_retry.py covers:
  - WSServerHandshakeError(status=401) stops the loop
  - a transient RuntimeError whose message contains "401" now retries
  - the pre-existing _closing early-return path is untouched

This file probes boundary/edge cases the implementer's tests did NOT
cover, per the independent-verifier mandate to go beyond what the
implementer thought to test:

  1. WSServerHandshakeError(status=403) — the other structured-check
     status value — must still stop the loop (only 401 was tested).
  2. WSServerHandshakeError with a non-auth status (e.g. 500) must NOT
     stop the loop — the structured check must not over-match.
  3. A transient exception containing "unauthorized" (not "401"/"403")
     must retry now that the substring fallback is fully removed —
     the implementer only exercised the "401" substring variant.
  4. Multiple consecutive transient errors must all retry (not just
     one) — proves the removed code path isn't silently reintroduced
     via some other mechanism after N attempts.
