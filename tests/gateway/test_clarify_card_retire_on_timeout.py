"""A clarify that ends without a click retires the adapter's native card (#110821, #111019).

Drives the real ``TurnRunner._clarify_callback_sync`` against a duck-typed adapter with a
persistent card: on timeout the gateway schedules ``retire_clarify_card`` with the expired
notice; an adapter without that method (text-prompt platforms) gets nothing scheduled.
