"""Who owns the gateway role on THIS host, and which profiles does that one process serve?

Multiplex-only (Teknium ruling): exactly ONE ``hermes gateway run`` per host, multiplexing every
profile. Every reporting surface (doctor, ``cron status``, ``claw``, the dashboard liveness ladder)
used to ask a per-PROFILE question instead — "does *my* profile own a gateway process?" — and a
profile that is SERVED by the host gateway answered "no". That produced three user-visible lies:
"not running", "Per-profile gateways: 0/3 up", and a silently skipped destructive-action warning.

:func:`host_gateway_topology` answers the real question once, from
:mod:`gateway.host_rendezvous` (the authoritative host record the winning process publishes),
falling back to the default home's recorded ``served_profiles`` for a gateway that predates the
record. ``default`` is just another served profile here, never a special owner.
