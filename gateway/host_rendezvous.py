"""Host-wide singleton rendezvous: one lock + one record per ROLE per OS user.

Multiplex-only (Teknium ruling): exactly ONE ``hermes serve`` and ONE ``hermes gateway run``
per host, each multiplexing every profile. The per-``HERMES_HOME`` gateway lock/PID files
(``gateway.status``) cannot express that — N profiles are N homes, so N processes each take
their own flock and none of them ever sees the others. This module adds the missing layer:

* a **host lock** (flock/``msvcrt``) held for the lifetime of the winning process, and
* a **rendezvous record** the winner publishes so a second invocation can find it, prove it
  is the same live process, and ATTACH instead of binding a second port.

Both live in :func:`gateway.status._get_lock_dir` — the only cross-profile lock root already
in the tree (``$HERMES_GATEWAY_LOCK_DIR`` else ``$XDG_STATE_HOME/hermes/gateway-locks``),
which scopes to the **OS user**. That is the correct granularity: separate OS users have
separate ``$HOME``s, separate ``~/.hermes`` profile roots, separate ports-by-convention and
separate credentials, so "one per host" means "one per host per OS user".

**Staleness is proved, never assumed.** A record carries ``(pid, createTime)``; a record whose
PID is dead, or whose PID is alive with a different process creation time (PID reuse), is
STALE and is ignored — an attaching client must never dial a recycled PID's port.

**Relationship to ``spawn-ledger.json``** (``hermes_cli/process_identity.py``): the ledger stays
the append-only machine roster of every long-lived Hermes process (Desktop's attach ladder reads
it) and is still written unchanged. It cannot be the host record: it has no lock, no
single-writer semantics, no removal on exit, and no place to publish a protocol version or
an authentication handle. The record here is authoritative for "who owns this host role"; the
ledger remains authoritative for "what is running". Both are written, and this module reuses the
ledger's ``(pid, create_time)`` liveness proof rather than inventing a second one.
