"""Gateway lifecycle ledger — durable termination-reason evidence.

Graceful shutdowns leave forensics (``gateway-exit-diag.log``); an unclean
death (SIGKILL, kernel OOM, VM death) runs no handler.  A sentinel at
``<HERMES_HOME>/state/gateway.lifecycle.json`` closes the gap:
:func:`record_startup` finds ``phase == "running"`` from the previous life →
unclean death, appended to the exit-diag log as ``gateway.previous_unclean_exit``
and logged at WARNING; :func:`mark_exited` rewrites ``phase=exited`` on every
clean exit path.  Best-effort: forensics must never affect the lifecycle.
