"""RelayAdapter — one generic gateway adapter fronted by the connector. EXPERIMENTAL.

A single ``BasePlatformAdapter`` subclass that receives a ``CapabilityDescriptor`` at
handshake (which platform it fronts, which capabilities to advertise) and delegates
all wire I/O to an injected transport. There is NO per-platform gateway code: only
the connector knows "this chat_id maps to a Discord channel"; the gateway sees an
ordinary ``MessageEvent`` in and calls ``adapter.send`` out. Transport protocol and
descriptor schema may change without a deprecation cycle until >=2 Class-1 platforms
validate them.
