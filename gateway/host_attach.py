"""Is there ONE live host gateway, and does it already serve this profile?

Multiplex-only (Teknium ruling): exactly one MULTIPLEXING ``hermes gateway run`` per host, serving
every profile; standalone per-profile gateways coexist until that migration is forced (#109417).
The lifecycle verbs therefore answer a different question than they used to — not "does THIS home
hold a ``gateway.pid``?" but "is the host process live, and is this profile in its served set?" —
and when it is not, they ask that process to serve the profile instead of starting a second one.
Five outcomes, in order:

* ``ATTACH``       — a live host gateway already serves this profile. Nothing to start; exit 0.
* ``RESCAN``→ATTACH — it does not serve it yet: ask it to reconcile ``profiles/`` now (control
  socket ``rescan-profiles``) and attach once the answer includes us.
* ``REPLACE_HOST`` — ``--replace`` targets the host process when it serves this profile, whichever
  home launched it. An owner that has not published its served set yet is targeted too, but the
  ownership guard (``run._replace_target_belongs_to_other_profile``) can then only prove it from
  THIS home's pid record, so from another home the replace is refused (exit 1).
* ``REFUSE``       — a live MULTIPLEXING gateway exists and cannot be made to serve this profile.
  Never start a second one silently.
* ``START``        — no live owner, or the owner answers ``multiplex: False``: it is another
  profile's standalone gateway (the documented one-process-per-profile topology), not a
  multiplexer that excluded us, so this profile runs its own gateway beside it as it always did.

**The attach channel is the OWNER's control socket, never ours.** Ordering matters: the owner
publishes its rendezvous record when it claims its PID file and binds its control socket a moment
later (``gateway/run.py``: claim → socket), so for a short window the record exists and the channel
does not. A reader that took "no socket" for "no owner" would start exactly the second gateway this
module prevents — but a reader that took the RECORD's word for the served set is worse: the
claim-time record is published before the process knows what it will serve, so a supervised unit
for a profile nobody serves would stand down forever. Hence the split:

* the record proves an OWNER exists (PID + createTime), and that alone never yields ATTACH;
* the served set comes ONLY from a live ``identify`` answer, waited for a bounded
  :data:`ATTACH_CHANNEL_WAIT_S`;
* owner present + served set unknown is a TRANSIENT verdict — do not start, do not park.

Nothing here depends on the *calling* process having started anything.
