# Adding a New Messaging Platform

There are two ways to add a platform to the Hermes gateway:

## Plugin Path (Recommended for Community/Third-Party)

Create a plugin directory in `~/.hermes/plugins/` (or under `plugins/platforms/`
for bundled plugins) with a `plugin.yaml` and `adapter.py`.  The adapter
inherits from `BasePlatformAdapter` and registers via
`ctx.register_platform()` in the `register(ctx)` entry point.  This requires
**zero changes to core Hermes code**.

The plugin system automatically handles: adapter creation, config parsing,
user authorization, cron delivery, send_message routing, system prompt hints,
status display, gateway setup, and more.

**Optional hooks cover the edges most adapters need:**

- `env_enablement_fn: () -> Optional[dict]` — seeds `PlatformConfig.extra`
  (and an optional `home_channel` dict) from env vars BEFORE the adapter is
  constructed.  Without this, env-only setups don't surface in
  `hermes gateway status` or `get_connected_platforms()` until the SDK
  instantiates.  Build it from a `(ENV_VAR, extra_key, conv)` table with
  `gateway.platforms._shared.seed_extra_from_env(spec, home_env=...)`; every
  read goes through `_shared.get_scoped_secret` (multiplex-safe, never
  `os.getenv`).
- `apply_yaml_config_fn: (yaml_cfg, platform_cfg) -> Optional[dict]` —
  translate this platform's `config.yaml` keys into env vars and seed
  `PlatformConfig.extra`.  Lets a plugin own its YAML schema instead of
  growing core `gateway/config.py` boilerplate per platform.  Declare a
  `(yaml_key, ENV_VAR, kind)` table and return
  `_shared.apply_yaml_bridge(platform_cfg, TABLE)`: it writes env only when
  unset (env > YAML), never under a multiplexed secondary profile's scope,
  and returns the same values for `extra` (read `extra` first in the adapter
  via `_shared.extra_or_secret`).  Called during `load_gateway_config()`
  after the generic shared-key loop and before `_apply_env_overrides()`.
- `is_connected: (config) -> bool` — for env-only platforms use
  `_shared.env_is_connected("YOUR_TOKEN_VAR", ...)` instead of a hand-rolled
  `get_env_value` check.
- `cron_deliver_env_var: str` — name of the `*_HOME_CHANNEL` env var.  When
  set, `deliver=<name>` cron jobs route to this var without editing
  `cron/scheduler.py`'s hardcoded sets.
- `standalone_sender_fn: async (...) -> dict`: out-of-process delivery
  for cron jobs that run separately from the gateway.  Without this, a
  `deliver=<name>` job fires correctly but the actual send returns
  `No live adapter for platform '<name>'`.  Pair with `cron_deliver_env_var`
  for end-to-end cron support.  See the docsite for the signature.
- `plugin.yaml` `requires_env` / `optional_env` rich-dict entries —
  auto-populate `OPTIONAL_ENV_VARS` in `hermes_cli/config.py` so the setup
  wizard surfaces proper descriptions, prompts, password flags, and URLs.

**Subclassing for platform-specific UX.** When a platform has a hard
time-window constraint that the base adapter can't anticipate (LINE's
60s single-use reply token, WhatsApp's 24h session window, etc.), an
adapter can override `_keep_typing` to layer a mid-flight bubble at a
threshold without expanding the kwarg surface. Always
`await super()._keep_typing(...)` so the typing heartbeat keeps running,
and tear down your side task in `finally`. See `plugins/platforms/line/`
for the full pattern (Template Buttons postback at 45s, `RequestCache`
state machine, `interrupt_session_activity` override for `/stop`
orphans) and the developer-guide page for the prose walkthrough.

**Sibling adapters that share behavior.** When a single platform has
two transport modes the user picks between — unofficial vs official
APIs, polling vs websocket, library A vs library B — the right
structure is two adapters that share a behavior mixin. WhatsApp does
this: `gateway/platforms/whatsapp.py` (Baileys bridge) and
`gateway/platforms/whatsapp_cloud.py` (Meta Cloud API) both inherit
from `WhatsAppBehaviorMixin` in `gateway/platforms/whatsapp_common.py`.
The mixin owns gating, allow-lists, mention parsing, broadcast
filters, and the WhatsApp-flavored markdown conversion — everything
that's platform-protocol-agnostic. Each adapter owns its transport.
Both register distinct `Platform.*` enum values so the gateway can run
both simultaneously against different phone numbers. The mixin must
come **first** in the bases list — `class WhatsAppAdapter(Mixin,
BasePlatformAdapter)` — so the mixin's `format_message` overrides
`BasePlatformAdapter`'s generic default.

See `plugins/platforms/irc/`, `plugins/platforms/teams/`, and
`plugins/platforms/google_chat/` for complete working examples, and
`website/docs/developer-guide/adding-platform-adapters.md` for the full
plugin guide with code examples and hook documentation.

---

Plugin-registered native handlers (`ctx.register_platform_handler(<platform>, factory)`): call
`self._wire_plugin_handlers(native_client)` once in `connect()` before your own catch-all handlers. The base
class then handles plugins that load mid-run — the runner calls `rewire_plugin_handlers()` on every
plugin-loaded event and only factories not yet wired on that native client run. Override it only when your
adapter keeps a second plugin registry (Slack action handlers) or dispatches by registration order with a
catch-all last (Telegram hoists late handlers ahead of core); see `gateway/run_plugin_rewire.py`.

## Built-in Path (Core Contributors Only)

Checklist for integrating a platform directly into the Hermes core.
Use this as a reference when building a built-in adapter — every item here
is a real integration point. Missing any of them will cause broken
functionality, missing features, or inconsistent behavior.

---

## 1. Core Adapter (`gateway/platforms/<platform>.py`)

The adapter is a subclass of `BasePlatformAdapter` from `gateway/platforms/base.py`.

### Required methods

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `__init__(self, config)` | Parse config, init state. Call `super().__init__(config, Platform.YOUR_PLATFORM)` |
| `connect() -> bool` | Connect to the platform, start listeners. Return True on success |
| `disconnect()` | Stop listeners, close connections, cancel tasks |
| `send(chat_id, text, ...) -> SendResult` | Send a text message |
| `send_typing(chat_id)` | Send typing indicator |
| `send_image(chat_id, image_url, caption) -> SendResult` | Send an image |
| `get_chat_info(chat_id) -> dict` | Return `{name, type, chat_id}` for a chat |

### Optional methods (have default stubs in base)

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `send_document(chat_id, path, caption)` | Send a file attachment |
| `send_voice(chat_id, path)` | Send a voice message |
| `send_video(chat_id, path, caption)` | Send a video |
| `send_animation(chat_id, path, caption)` | Send a GIF/animation |
| `send_image_file(chat_id, path, caption)` | Send image from local file |

### Interactive UX (recommended if your platform supports tappable buttons)

If your platform supports interactive button/menu messages, implement these for a more polished agent experience. They all degrade gracefully to plain text when not overridden:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `send_clarify(chat_id, question, choices, clarify_id, session_key, ...)` | Render the `clarify` tool's multi-choice question as tappable buttons. Pair with inbound dispatch that routes button taps to `tools.clarify_gateway.resolve_gateway_clarify`. |
| `_send_exec_approval_prompt(prompt: ExecApprovalPrompt)` | Render a dangerous-command approval as native buttons. `send_exec_approval` is a base template method: it builds the shared text (`_format_exec_approval`, tune via the `_EA_*` class attrs) and the choice set (`prompt.actions` = `(label, choice, style)` rows, choices `once`/`session`/`always`/`deny`) — you only map those rows to widgets. Inbound dispatch routes to `tools.approval.resolve_gateway_approval`. |
| `send_slash_confirm(chat_id, title, message, session_key, confirm_id, ...)` | Render slash-command confirmations (e.g. `/reload-mcp`) as Once/Always/Cancel buttons. Inbound dispatch routes to `tools.slash_confirm.resolve`. |
| `send_model_picker(...)` | Interactive `/model` picker. Used by Telegram, Discord, and Slack (Socket Mode). |
| `send_choice_picker(...)` | Flat single-level picker for finite-choice commands (`/reasoning`, `/fast`). Implemented by Telegram (inline keyboard), Discord (select menu), and Matrix (reactions). Platforms without it fall back to the text status card automatically. |

See `gateway/platforms/telegram.py`, `discord.py`, and `whatsapp_cloud.py` for reference implementations. The button-callback id convention (`cl:<id>:<idx>`, `appr:<id>:<choice>`, `sc:<choice>:<id>`) is shared across adapters — match it so the gateway-side resolvers work without modification.

### Required function

```python
def check_<platform>_requirements() -> bool:
    """Check if this platform's dependencies are available."""
```

### Key patterns to follow

- Use `self.build_source(...)` to construct `SessionSource` objects (never `SessionSource(...)`
  directly — the transport provenance and profile route are stamped there)
- Derive every adapter-side session key (batching, per-chat queues, busy detection) through
  `self._event_session_key(event)` / `self._source_session_key(source)`, never the free
  `build_session_key()` — the seam keys in the owning profile's namespace under a multiplexed
  gateway; the advisory lint (`scripts/check_profile_scope_patterns.py`, pattern P32) flags both
- Call `self.handle_message(event)` to dispatch inbound messages to the gateway
- Use `MessageEvent`, `MessageType` from `gateway.platforms.event` and `SendResult` from base
- Use `cache_image_from_bytes`, `cache_audio_from_bytes`, `cache_document_from_bytes` for attachments
- Filter self-messages (prevent reply loops)
- Drop redelivered inbound IDs with `MessageDeduplicator` (`gateway/platforms/helpers.py`) held as an adapter
  attribute; the runner's reconnect copies its live IDs into the rebuilt adapter, a hand-rolled cache starts empty
- Filter sync/echo messages if the platform has them
- Redact sensitive identifiers (phone numbers, tokens) in all log output
- Implement reconnection with exponential backoff + jitter for streaming connections
- Set `MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH` if the platform has message size limits

---

## 2. Platform Enum (`gateway/config.py`)

Add the platform to the `Platform` enum:

```python
class Platform(Enum):
    ...
    YOUR_PLATFORM = "your_platform"
```

Add a row to `_ENV_STEPS` in `gateway/config_env.py` (source order = application order);
`_Cred` enables the platform when the named env vars resolve and copies them into `extra`:

```python
_Cred(Platform.YOUR_PLATFORM, ("YOUR_PLATFORM_TOKEN",), token="YOUR_PLATFORM_TOKEN"),
_Home(Platform.YOUR_PLATFORM, "YOUR_PLATFORM_HOME_CHANNEL"),
```

Every read goes through `gateway/config.py::_getenv` (the active profile's secret scope when one
is bound, `os.environ` otherwise). **Never `os.getenv` here and never write `os.environ`**: under
`gateway.multiplex_profiles` the process env is the DEFAULT profile's, so a raw read enables your
platform for the wrong profile with the wrong credentials, and a write pins one profile's policy
process-wide (first profile wins). Adapter-side reads use `gateway.platforms._shared.get_scoped_secret`
/ `extra_or_secret`.

Update `get_connected_platforms()` if your platform doesn't use token/api_key
(e.g., WhatsApp uses `enabled` flag, Signal uses `extra` dict).

---

## 3. Adapter Factory (`gateway/run.py`)

Add to `_instantiate_adapter()`:

```python
elif platform == Platform.YOUR_PLATFORM:
    from gateway.platforms.your_platform import YourAdapter, check_your_requirements
    if not check_your_requirements():
        logger.warning("Your Platform: dependencies not met")
        return None
    return YourAdapter(config)
```

`_create_adapter()` wraps this factory and binds every successful adapter to
its `GatewayRunner`. Do not construct platform adapters in lifecycle call sites;
startup and reconnect must keep using the wrapper so profile routing is wired
before `connect()`.

---

## 4. Authorization Maps (`gateway/pairing.py`, `gateway/authz_mixin.py`)

Add the allowlist var to `_PLATFORM_ALLOWLIST_ENV` in `gateway/pairing.py`;
`authz_mixin.py` derives `_ALLOWED_USERS_ENV` / `_ALLOW_ALL_ENV` from it (the `*_ALLOW_ALL_USERS`
name is computed, not hand-listed):

```python
_PLATFORM_ALLOWLIST_ENV = {
    ...
    "your_platform": "YOUR_PLATFORM_ALLOWED_USERS",
}
```

Plugin adapters declare `allowed_users_env` / `allow_all_env` on `ctx.register_platform` instead.
`_is_user_authorized()` reads every gate through `_shared.platform_gate_env` (`_auth_env`), which
answers from the routed profile's secret scope under multiplex — never add an `os.getenv` here.

---

## 5. Session Source (`gateway/session.py`)

If your platform needs extra identity fields (e.g., Signal's UUID alongside
phone number), add them to the `SessionSource` dataclass with `Optional` defaults,
and update `to_dict()`, `from_dict()`, and `build_source()` in base.py.

---

## 6. System Prompt Hints (`agent/prompt_builder.py`)

Add a `PLATFORM_HINTS` entry so the agent knows what platform it's on:

```python
PLATFORM_HINTS = {
    ...
    "your_platform": (
        "You are on Your Platform. "
        "Describe formatting capabilities, media support, etc."
    ),
}
```

Without this, the agent won't know it's on your platform and may use
inappropriate formatting (e.g., markdown on platforms that don't render it).

---

## 7. Toolset (`toolsets.py`)

Add a named toolset for your platform:

```python
"hermes-your-platform": {
    "description": "Your Platform bot toolset",
    "tools": _HERMES_CORE_TOOLS,
    "includes": []
},
```

And add it to the `hermes-gateway` composite:

```python
"hermes-gateway": {
    "includes": [..., "hermes-your-platform"]
}
```

---

## 8. Cron Delivery (`cron/scheduler.py`)

Add to `platform_map` in `_deliver_result()`:

```python
platform_map = {
    ...
    "your_platform": Platform.YOUR_PLATFORM,
}
```

Without this, `cronjob(action="create", deliver="your_platform", ...)` silently fails.

---

## 9. Send Message Tool (`tools/send_message_tool.py`)

Add to `platform_map` in `send_message_tool()`:

```python
platform_map = {
    ...
    "your_platform": Platform.YOUR_PLATFORM,
}
```

Add routing in `_send_to_platform()`:

```python
elif platform == Platform.YOUR_PLATFORM:
    return await _send_your_platform(pconfig, chat_id, message)
```

Implement `_send_your_platform()` — a standalone async function that sends
a single message without requiring the full adapter (for use by cron jobs
and the send_message tool outside the gateway process).

Update the tool schema `target` description to include your platform example.

---

## 10. Cronjob Tool Schema (`tools/cronjob_tools.py`)

Update the `deliver` parameter description and docstring to mention your
platform as a delivery option.

---

## 11. Channel Directory (`gateway/channel_directory.py`)

If your platform can't enumerate chats (most can't), add it to the
session-based discovery list:

```python
for plat_name in ("telegram", "whatsapp", "signal", "your_platform"):
```

---

## 12. Status Display (`hermes_cli/status.py`)

Add to the `platforms` dict in the Messaging Platforms section:

```python
platforms = {
    ...
    "Your Platform": ("YOUR_PLATFORM_TOKEN", "YOUR_PLATFORM_HOME_CHANNEL"),
}
```

---

## 13. Gateway Setup Wizard (`hermes_cli/gateway.py`)

Add to the `_PLATFORMS` list:

```python
{
    "key": "your_platform",
    "label": "Your Platform",
    "emoji": "📱",
    "token_var": "YOUR_PLATFORM_TOKEN",
    "setup_instructions": [...],
    "vars": [...],
}
```

If your platform needs custom setup logic (connectivity testing, QR codes,
policy choices), add a `_setup_your_platform()` function and route to it
in the platform selection switch.

Update `_platform_status()` if your platform's "configured" check differs
from the standard `bool(get_env_value(token_var))`.

---

## 14. Phone/ID Redaction (`agent/redact.py`)

If your platform uses sensitive identifiers (phone numbers, etc.), add a
regex pattern and redaction function to `agent/redact.py`. This ensures
identifiers are masked in ALL log output, not just your adapter's logs.

---

## 15. Documentation

| File | What to update |
|------|---------------|
| `README.md` | Platform list in feature table + documentation table |
| `AGENTS.md` | Gateway description + env var config section |
| `website/docs/user-guide/messaging/<platform>.md` | **NEW** — Full setup guide (see existing platform docs for template) |
| `website/docs/user-guide/messaging/index.md` | Architecture diagram, toolset table, security examples, Next Steps links |
| `website/docs/reference/environment-variables.md` | All env vars for the platform |

---

## 16. Tests (`tests/gateway/test_<platform>.py`)

Recommended test coverage:

- Platform enum exists with correct value
- Config loading from env vars via `_apply_env_overrides`
- Adapter init (config parsing, allowlist handling, default values)
- Helper functions (redaction, parsing, file type detection)
- Session source round-trip (to_dict → from_dict)
- Authorization integration (platform in allowlist maps)
- Send message tool routing (platform in platform_map)

Optional but valuable:
- Async tests for message handling flow (mock the platform API)
- SSE/WebSocket reconnection logic
- Attachment processing
- Group message filtering

---

## Quick Verification

After implementing everything, verify with:

```bash
# All tests pass
python -m pytest tests/ -q

# Grep for your platform name to find any missed integration points
grep -r "telegram\|discord\|whatsapp\|slack" gateway/ tools/ agent/ cron/ hermes_cli/ toolsets.py \
  --include="*.py" -l | sort -u
# Check each file in the output — if it mentions other platforms but not yours, you missed it
```
