# Profile Commands Reference

This page covers all commands related to [Hermes profiles](../user-guide/profiles.md). For general CLI commands, see [CLI Commands Reference](./cli-commands.md).

## `hermes profile`

```bash
hermes profile <subcommand>
```

Top-level command for managing profiles. Running `hermes profile` without a subcommand shows help.

| Subcommand | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `list` | List all profiles. |
| `use` | Set the active (default) profile. |
| `create` | Create a new profile. |
| `describe` | Read or set a profile's description (used by the kanban orchestrator for routing). |
| `delete` | Delete a profile. |
| `show` | Show details about a profile. |
| `alias` | Regenerate the shell alias for a profile. |
| `rename` | Rename a profile. |
| `export` | Export a profile to a tar.gz archive. |
| `import` | Import a profile from a tar.gz archive. |
| `install` | Install a profile distribution from a git URL or local directory. See [Profile Distributions](../user-guide/profile-distributions.md). |
| `update` | Re-pull a distribution-managed profile and re-apply its bundle. |
| `info` | Show distribution metadata for a profile (origin URL, commit, last update). |

## `hermes profile list`

```bash
hermes profile list
```

Lists all profiles. The currently active profile is marked with `*`.

**Example:**

```bash
$ hermes profile list
  default
* work
  dev
  personal
```

No options.

## `hermes profile use`

```bash
hermes profile use <name>
```

Sets `<name>` as the active profile. All subsequent `hermes` commands (without `-p`) will use this profile.

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile name to activate. Use `default` to return to the base profile. |

**Example:**

```bash
hermes profile use work
hermes profile use default
```

## `hermes profile create`

```bash
hermes profile create <name> [options]
```

Creates a new profile.

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Name for the new profile. Must be a valid directory name (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores). |
| `--clone` | Copy `config.yaml`, `.env`, `SOUL.md`, skills, the curated `memories/MEMORY.md` / `memories/USER.md`, and the active `memory.provider`'s own config (`<provider>/` or `<provider>.json`, e.g. `hindsight/config.json`) from the current profile. Sessions, `state.db` and cron jobs are not copied. |
| `--clone-all` | Copy everything (config, memories, skills, plugins) from the current profile. Excludes per-profile history: sessions, `state.db`, backups, state-snapshots, checkpoints — and cron jobs, which stay bound to the source profile (a clone that inherited them would fire every job twice). When the source is the default profile, the machine-scoped local-model trees (`models/`, `runtimes/`, `node/`) are also skipped — the same trees `hermes backup` excludes. |
| `--clone-from <profile>` | Clone config/skills/SOUL from a specific profile instead of the current one. Implies `--clone` unless paired with `--clone-all`. |
| `--no-alias` | Skip wrapper script creation. |
| `--description "<text>"` | One- or two-sentence description of what this profile is good at. Used by the kanban orchestrator to route tasks based on role instead of profile name alone. Skip and add later via `hermes profile describe`. Persisted in `<profile_dir>/profile.yaml`. |
| `--no-skills` | Create an **empty** profile with zero bundled skills enabled. Writes a `.no-bundled-skills` marker into the profile so future `hermes update` runs won't re-seed the bundled set, and refuses to combine with `--clone`, `--clone-from`, or `--clone-all` (which would copy skills in anyway). Useful for narrow orchestrator profiles or sandbox profiles that should not inherit the full skill catalog. To toggle this on an already-created profile (including the default `~/.hermes`), use `hermes skills opt-out` / `hermes skills opt-in`. |

Creating a profile does **not** make that profile directory the default project/workspace directory for terminal commands. If you want a profile to start in a specific project, set `terminal.cwd` in that profile's `config.yaml`.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Blank profile — needs full setup
hermes profile create mybot

# Clone config only from current profile
hermes profile create work --clone

# Clone everything from current profile
hermes profile create backup --clone-all

# Clone config from a specific profile
hermes profile create work2 --clone-from work

# Clone everything from a specific profile
hermes profile create work2-backup --clone-from work --clone-all
```

## `hermes profile describe`

```bash
hermes profile describe [<name>] [options]
```

Read or set a profile's description. The description is consumed by the kanban orchestrator to route tasks based on what each profile is good at, rather than guessing from the profile name alone. Persisted in `<profile_dir>/profile.yaml` so it survives reboots and is shared with the gateway.

With no flags, prints the current description (or `(no description set for '<name>')` if empty).

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile to describe. Required unless `--all --auto` is used. |
| `--text "<text>"` | Set the description to this exact text (user-authored). Overwrites any existing description. |
| `--auto` | Auto-generate a 1-2 sentence description via the auxiliary LLM, based on the profile's installed skills, configured model, and name. Configure the model under `auxiliary.profile_describer` in `config.yaml`. Auto-generated descriptions are marked `description_auto: true` so the dashboard can flag them for review. |
| `--overwrite` | With `--auto`, replace user-authored descriptions too (default: skip profiles whose description was set explicitly). |
| `--all` | With `--auto`, sweep every profile missing a description. |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Read the current description
hermes profile describe researcher

# Set it explicitly
hermes profile describe researcher --text "Reads source code and writes findings."

# Let the LLM generate one
hermes profile describe researcher --auto

# Fill in descriptions for every profile that doesn't have one
hermes profile describe --all --auto
```

## `hermes profile delete`

```bash
hermes profile delete <name> [options]
```

Deletes a profile and removes its shell alias.

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile to delete. |
| `--yes`, `-y` | Skip confirmation prompt. |

**Example:**

```bash
hermes profile delete mybot
hermes profile delete mybot --yes
```

:::warning
This permanently deletes the profile's entire directory including all config, memories, sessions, and skills. The `default` profile (`~/.hermes`) cannot be deleted — use `hermes uninstall` to remove everything.
:::

## `hermes profile show`

```bash
hermes profile show <name>
```

Displays details about a profile including its home directory, configured model, gateway status, skills count, and configuration file status.

The skills count here (and in `hermes profile list`) is counted on the spot. The Desktop and dashboard profile lists are polled every few seconds, so they show the last known count instead and refresh it in the background — a freshly started backend may briefly show `0` skills for a profile until the first background count lands, and a skill you just installed appears in those lists within about a minute.

This shows the profile's Hermes home directory, not the terminal working directory. Terminal commands start from `terminal.cwd` (or the launch directory on the local backend when `cwd: "."`).

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile to inspect. |

**Example:**

```bash
$ hermes profile show work
Profile: work
Path:    ~/.hermes/profiles/work
Model:   anthropic/claude-sonnet-4 (anthropic)
Gateway: stopped
Skills:  12
.env:    exists
SOUL.md: exists
Alias:   ~/.local/bin/work
```

## `hermes profile alias`

```bash
hermes profile alias <name> [options]
```

Regenerates the shell alias script at `~/.local/bin/<name>`. Useful if the alias was accidentally deleted or if you need to update it after moving your Hermes installation.

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile to create/update the alias for. |
| `--remove` | Remove the wrapper script instead of creating it. |
| `--name <alias>` | Custom alias name (default: profile name). |

**Example:**

```bash
hermes profile alias work
# Creates/updates ~/.local/bin/work

hermes profile alias work --name mywork
# Creates ~/.local/bin/mywork

hermes profile alias work --remove
# Removes the wrapper script
```

## `hermes profile rename`

```bash
hermes profile rename <old-name> <new-name>
```

Renames a profile. Updates the directory and shell alias.

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<old-name>` | Current profile name. |
| `<new-name>` | New profile name. |

**Example:**

```bash
hermes profile rename mybot assistant
# ~/.hermes/profiles/mybot → ~/.hermes/profiles/assistant
# ~/.local/bin/mybot → ~/.local/bin/assistant
```

The rename also migrates the profile's persisted session/routing identity — session keys
(`agent:<old>:*`), `sessions.profile_name`, heartbeats, and routing/delivery rows — to the new
name. A live multiplexed gateway owns that migration (it holds the routing index in memory), so
when it is running the CLI delegates to it. Checkpoint (`/rollback`) history of workspaces that
live inside the profile directory is rekeyed to their new path as well, so it stays reachable
after the rename; `hermes profile migrate-identity` retries that step too if it was reported as
failed.

## `hermes profile migrate-identity`

```bash
hermes profile migrate-identity <old-name> <new-name>
```

Retries the identity migration of a rename that already completed. Run it if `hermes profile
rename` warned that the live gateway could not migrate session identity: restart the gateway
(it reloads the routing index from the database, so the migration lands), or stop it — with no
gateway holding the store the command performs the durable rewrite itself.

The migration is driven by the rows that still name `<old>`, so `profiles/<old>` does not have
to exist; only `<new>` is checked. Idempotent — re-running a completed migration succeeds with
nothing left to rekey. Exits non-zero when a live gateway refuses the migration, when a
database rejects the rewrite (a routing collision, a lock, or one of the two databases failing
while the other succeeds), naming the database and error.

**Example:**

```bash
hermes profile rename mybot assistant
# ⚠ Profile was renamed, but the live gateway could not migrate session identity (…).
#   Restart the gateway, then run:
#     hermes profile migrate-identity mybot assistant

hermes profile migrate-identity mybot assistant
# ✓ Session/routing identity migrated: mybot → assistant
```

## `hermes profile purge-identity`

```bash
hermes profile purge-identity <name>
```

Retries the identity purge of a delete that already completed. Run it if `hermes profile delete`
reported that its session/routing identity settlement is still pending: restart the gateway (it
reloads the routing index from the database, so the purge lands), or stop it — with no gateway
holding the store the command performs the durable delete itself.

The purge keys off `<name>` alone, so the profile directory does not have to exist — but a profile
that is live again under that name is refused: identity is settled by name, so purging it would take
the new profile's routing with it. Routing keys (`agent:<name>:*`), heartbeat rows and the profile's
Telegram topic bindings/mode rows are deleted; `delivery_obligations` rows are marked `abandoned`
rather than dropped, so pending delivery state is not lost silently. Session rows are not deleted by
the purge itself — it settles identity, not history; whether a conversation record outlives a delete
is decided by `hermes profile delete`, which removes the profile's own `profiles/<name>/`, its
`state.db` included. Idempotent — re-running a completed purge succeeds with nothing left to purge.
Exits non-zero when the name is a live profile again, when a live gateway refuses the purge, or when
a database rejects the delete (a lock, or a partial failure).

**Example:**

```bash
hermes profile delete mybot
# ⚠ Profile was deleted, but the live gateway could not purge its session identity (…).
#   Restart the gateway, then run:
#     hermes profile purge-identity mybot

hermes profile purge-identity mybot
# ✓ Session/routing identity purged: mybot
```

## `hermes profile export`

```bash
hermes profile export <name> [options]
```

Exports a profile as a compressed tar.gz archive — a portable snapshot you can back up, move to another machine, or hand to someone else. `auth.json` and `.env` are always excluded.

Also available in chat as [`/export`](./slash-commands.md), and in the desktop app via **⌘K → Export profile…** or a profile square's right-click menu. A desktop export additionally stages `desktop.json` (skin, light/dark mode, custom themes, rail color, window layout) into the archive.

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile to export. |
| `-o`, `--output <path>` | Output file path (default: `<name>.tar.gz`). |

**Example:**

```bash
hermes profile export work
# Creates work.tar.gz in the current directory

hermes profile export work -o ./work-2026-03-29.tar.gz
```

See [Export and import a profile file](../user-guide/profile-distributions.md#export-and-import-a-profile-file) for exactly what lands in the archive and what to check before sending one to someone else.

## `hermes profile import`

```bash
hermes profile import <archive> [options]
```

Imports a profile from a tar.gz archive, as a new profile. Refuses to overwrite an existing profile, and cannot import as `default` (the built-in root profile) — pass `--name` in either case. A shell wrapper is created when the name doesn't collide with an existing command.

Also available in chat as [`/import`](./slash-commands.md), and in the desktop app via **⌘K → Import profile…** or the import button beside the profile rail's **+**. A desktop import also applies any bundled `desktop.json` overlay (theme, layout) and switches you into the new profile.

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<archive>` | Path to the tar.gz archive to import. |
| `--name <name>` | Name for the imported profile (default: inferred from archive). |

**Example:**

```bash
hermes profile import ./work-2026-03-29.tar.gz
# Infers profile name from the archive

hermes profile import ./work-2026-03-29.tar.gz --name work-restored
```

## Distribution commands

:::tip
**New to distributions?** Start with the [Profile Distributions user guide](../user-guide/profile-distributions.md) — it covers the why, when, and how with full examples. The sections below are a dry CLI reference for when you know what you want.
:::

Distributions turn a profile into a shareable, versioned artifact published
as a **git repository**. A recipient installs the distribution with a single
command and can update it in place later without touching their local
memories, sessions, or credentials.

`auth.json` and `.env` are never part of a distribution — they stay on the
installing user's machine.

The recipient's user data (memories, sessions, auth, their own edits to
`.env`) is always preserved across the initial install and subsequent
updates.

:::info
Two ways to share a profile, and they complement each other. `hermes profile export` / `import` (also `/export` and `/import` in chat) produce a **single file** — no repo, no manifest, and a desktop export carries your theme and layout too. Distribution (`install` / `update` / `info`) publishes a profile as a **git repo** so recipients can pull versioned updates later. Backup and restore is the export file's other job. See [Two ways to share a profile](../user-guide/profile-distributions.md#two-ways-to-share-a-profile).
:::

### `hermes profile install`

```bash
hermes profile install <source> [--name <name>] [--alias] [--force] [--yes]
```

Installs a profile distribution from a git URL or a local directory.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `<source>` | Git URL (`github.com/user/repo`, `https://...`, `git@...`, `ssh://`, `git://`) or a local directory containing `distribution.yaml` at its root. |
| `--name NAME` | Override the profile name from the manifest. |
| `--alias` | Also create a shell wrapper (e.g. `telemetry` → `hermes -p telemetry`). |
| `--force` | Overwrite an existing profile of the same name. User data is still preserved. |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Skip the manifest-preview confirmation prompt. |

The installer shows the manifest, lists required env vars, and warns about
cron jobs before asking for confirmation. Required env vars go into a
`.env.EXAMPLE` file you copy to `.env` and fill in.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Install from a GitHub repo (shorthand)
hermes profile install github.com/kyle/telemetry-distribution --alias

# Install from a full HTTPS git URL
hermes profile install https://github.com/kyle/telemetry-distribution.git

# Install from SSH
hermes profile install git@github.com:kyle/telemetry-distribution.git

# Install from a local directory during development
hermes profile install ./telemetry/
```

### `hermes profile update`

```bash
hermes profile update <name> [--force-config] [--yes]
```

Re-clones the distribution from its recorded source and applies updates.
Distribution-owned files (SOUL.md, mcp.json) are overwritten and the
skills and cron jobs the distribution ships are replaced; skills or cron
jobs you added under `skills/` or `cron/` yourself stay in place. User data
(memories, sessions, auth, .env) is never touched. A symlinked `skills/`,
`cron/` or skill category directory is refused before anything is written — replace the link with a real
directory and re-run.

`config.yaml` is preserved by default to keep your local overrides.
Pass `--force-config` to reset it to the distribution's shipped config.

### `hermes profile info`

```bash
hermes profile info <name>
```

Prints the profile's distribution manifest — name, version, required
Hermes version, author, env var requirements, the source URL/path, and
the `Installed:` timestamp recorded when the distribution was last
`install`-ed or `update`-d. Useful for checking what a shared profile
needs before installing it, and for spotting "this profile was installed
6 months ago and hasn't been updated."

`hermes profile list` also shows the distribution name and version in a
`Distribution` column, and `hermes profile show <name>` / `delete <name>`
surface the source URL so you can tell at a glance which profiles came
from a git repo vs. were created locally.

### Private distributions

A private git repository works as a distribution source with no extra
configuration — the install shells out to your normal `git` binary, so
whatever authentication your shell is already set up for (SSH key,
`git credential` helper, GitHub CLI's stored HTTPS credentials) applies
transparently.

```bash
# Uses your SSH key, the same as any other `git clone`
hermes profile install git@github.com:your-org/internal-assistant.git

# Uses your git credential helper
hermes profile install https://github.com/your-org/internal-assistant.git
```

If a clone prompts for credentials interactively in your terminal during
install, that prompt flows through. Set up your auth the way you'd
normally use `git clone` against the same repo first, then install.

### Distribution manifest (`distribution.yaml`)

Every distribution has a `distribution.yaml` at the root of its repository:

```yaml
name: telemetry
version: 0.1.0
description: "Compliance monitoring harness"
hermes_requires: ">=0.12.0"
author: "Your Name"
license: "MIT"
env_requires:
  - name: OPENAI_API_KEY
    description: "OpenAI API key"
    required: true
  - name: GRAPHITI_MCP_URL
    description: "Memory graph URL"
    required: false
    default: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse"
distribution_owned:   # optional; defaults to SOUL.md, config.yaml,
                      #   mcp.json, skills/, cron/, distribution.yaml
  - SOUL.md
  - skills/compliance/
  - cron/
```

`hermes_requires` supports `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, or a bare
version (treated as `>=`). Install fails with a clear error if the current
Hermes version doesn't satisfy the spec.

`distribution_owned` is optional. If set, only those paths are replaced on
update; anything else in the profile stays user-owned. If omitted, the
defaults above apply.

### Publishing a distribution

Authoring a distribution is just a git push:

1. In your profile directory, create `distribution.yaml` with at least `name`
   and `version`.
2. Initialize a git repo (or use an existing one) and push to GitHub /
   GitLab / any host Hermes can clone from.
3. Tell recipients to run `hermes profile install <your-repo-url>`.

Use git tags for versioned releases — recipients who clone `HEAD` get your
latest state, and you can always bump `version:` in the manifest.

## `hermes -p` / `hermes --profile`

```bash
hermes -p <name> <command> [options]
hermes --profile <name> <command> [options]
```

Global flag to run any Hermes command under a specific profile without changing the sticky default. This overrides the active profile for the duration of the command.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-p <name>`, `--profile <name>` | Profile to use for this command. |

**Examples:**

```bash
hermes -p work chat -q "Check the server status"
hermes --profile dev gateway start
hermes -p personal skills list
hermes -p work config edit
```

## `hermes completion`

```bash
hermes completion <shell>
```

Generates shell completion scripts. Includes completions for profile names and profile subcommands.

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<shell>` | Shell to generate completions for: `bash`, `zsh`, or `fish`. |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Install completions
hermes completion bash >> ~/.bashrc
hermes completion zsh >> ~/.zshrc
hermes completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/hermes.fish

# Reload shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

After installation, tab completion works for:
- `hermes profile <TAB>` — subcommands (list, use, create, etc.)
- `hermes profile use <TAB>` — profile names
- `hermes -p <TAB>` — profile names
