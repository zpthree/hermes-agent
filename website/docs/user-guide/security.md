# Security

Hermes Agent is designed with a defense-in-depth security model. This page covers every security boundary — from command approval to container isolation to user authorization on messaging platforms.

## Overview

The security model has eight layers:

1. **User authorization** — who can talk to the agent (allowlists, DM pairing)
2. **Dangerous command approval** — human-in-the-loop for destructive operations
3. **File write safety** — denylist and optional write sandbox for `write_file`/`patch`
4. **Container isolation** — Docker/Singularity/Modal sandboxing with hardened settings
5. **MCP credential filtering** — environment variable isolation for MCP subprocesses
6. **Context file scanning** — prompt injection detection in project files
7. **Cross-session isolation** — sessions cannot access each other's data or state; cron job storage paths are hardened against path traversal attacks
8. **Input sanitization** — working directory parameters in terminal tool backends are validated against an allowlist to prevent shell injection

## Dangerous Command Approval

Before executing any command, Hermes checks it against a curated list of dangerous patterns. If a match is found, the user must explicitly approve it.

### Approval Modes

The approval system supports three modes, configured via `approvals.mode` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
approvals:
  mode: smart                     # smart | manual | off
  timeout: 300                    # seconds to wait for user response (default: 300)
  cron_mode: deny                 # deny | approve — what cron jobs do when they hit a dangerous command
  single_query_mode: deny         # deny | approve — what single-query (-q) sessions do on a dangerous command
  unattended_mode: deny           # deny | approve — what webhook/API sessions do on a dangerous command
  mcp_reload_confirm: true        # /reload-mcp asks before invalidating the MCP tool cache
  destructive_slash_confirm: true # /clear, /new, /reset, /undo prompt before discarding state
```

The full set of keys:

| Key | Default | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| `mode` | `smart` | Approval policy for dangerous shell commands — see the table below. |
| `timeout` | `300` | Seconds Hermes waits for an approval reply before timing out. |
| `cron_mode` | `deny` | How [cron jobs](./features/cron.md) behave headlessly when they trigger a dangerous-command prompt. `deny` blocks the command (the agent must find another path); `approve` auto-approves everything in cron context. |
| `single_query_mode` | `deny` | How one-shot [`hermes chat -q`](./cli.md) sessions behave when they trigger a dangerous-command prompt. A `-q` session runs a single turn and exits with no user waiting to answer prompts; `deny` blocks the command (the agent must find another path), `approve` auto-approves everything in single-query context. Mirrors `cron_mode`. |
| `unattended_mode` | `deny` | How sessions on unattended programmatic platforms (webhook, msgraph_webhook, api_server) behave when they trigger a dangerous-command prompt. These surfaces have no human who can answer `/approve`, so instead of blocking for the full approval timeout, `deny` blocks the command instantly (the agent must find another path) and `approve` auto-approves everything in unattended context. Mirrors `cron_mode`. |
| `mcp_reload_confirm` | `true` | When true, `/reload-mcp` asks before rebuilding the MCP tool set. Rebuilding invalidates the provider prompt cache (tool schemas live in the system prompt), so the next message re-sends full input tokens. Users who click **Always Approve** flip this key to `false`. |
| `destructive_slash_confirm` | `true` | When true, destructive session slash commands (`/clear`, `/new`, `/reset`, `/undo`) prompt before discarding conversation state. Three-option dialog (Approve Once / Always Approve / Cancel) routed through native yes/no buttons on Telegram, Discord, and Slack; text fallback elsewhere. Users who click **Always Approve** flip this key to `false`. The TUI also honors this setting for its `/clear`, `/new`, and `/reset` modal; `HERMES_TUI_NO_CONFIRM=1` force-skips that modal regardless of the configured value. |

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **smart** (default) | Use an auxiliary LLM to assess risk. Low-risk commands (e.g., `python -c "print('hello')"`) are auto-approved for that command only. Genuinely dangerous commands are auto-denied. Uncertain cases escalate to a manual prompt. |
| **manual** | Always prompt the user for approval on dangerous commands. |
| **off** | Disable all approval checks — equivalent to running with `--yolo`. All commands execute without prompts. |

:::warning
Setting `approvals.mode: off` disables all safety prompts. Use only in trusted environments (CI/CD, containers, etc.).
:::

### YOLO Mode

YOLO mode bypasses **all** dangerous command approval prompts for the current session. It can be activated three ways:

1. **CLI flag**: Start a session with `hermes --yolo` or `hermes chat --yolo`
2. **Slash command**: Type `/yolo` during a session to toggle it on/off
3. **Environment variable**: Set `HERMES_YOLO_MODE=1`

The `/yolo` command is a **toggle** — each use flips the mode on or off:

```
> /yolo
  ⚡ YOLO mode ON — all commands auto-approved. Use with caution.

> /yolo
  ⚠ YOLO mode OFF — dangerous commands will require approval.
```

YOLO mode is available in both CLI and gateway sessions. Internally, it sets the `HERMES_YOLO_MODE` environment variable which is checked before every command execution.

When YOLO is active, Hermes shows two persistent visual reminders so it's hard to forget that approval prompts are bypassed:

- A red banner line at session start when YOLO is already active: `⚠ YOLO mode — all approval prompts bypassed`. Hidden when YOLO is off so the default banner stays uncluttered.
- A `⚠ YOLO` fragment in the status bar across all width tiers, updated live as you toggle YOLO on or off (rich-text renderer and plain-text fallback).

:::danger
YOLO mode disables **all** dangerous command safety checks for the session — **except** the hardline blocklist (see below). Use only when you fully trust the commands being generated (e.g., well-tested automation scripts in disposable environments).
:::

For destructive session slash commands (`/clear`, `/new` / `/reset`, `/undo`, `/quit --delete` — `/exit --delete` is an alias), the CLI also prompts for confirmation before running them. See [Slash Commands — Confirmation prompts for destructive commands](../reference/slash-commands.md#confirmation-prompts-for-destructive-commands).

### Supervised-gateway lifecycle restriction

The terminal tool has a separate, non-overridable guard against stopping or
restarting the gateway from inside its own supervised process. A self-restart can
terminate the tool before it finishes and cause a supervisor/auto-resume loop.
User approval, YOLO mode, and `force=True` do not bypass this guard.

The guard also refuses process killers aimed at the interpreter image the gateway
runs as — `taskkill /F /IM python.exe`, `taskkill /FI "IMAGENAME eq python.exe"`,
`Stop-Process -Name python`, `pkill -9 python3`, `killall python`, `pkill -f python`,
and name-derived kills such as `pgrep python | xargs kill` — because a supervised
gateway is literally a `python` process and such a command takes it (and the agent's
own turn) down. Kills scoped to a process the agent owns pass: the `proc_*` id of a
background job (`process(action="kill", …)`) or an explicit PID
(`taskkill /F /PID <pid>`, `kill <pid>`). Other image names (`taskkill /F /IM notepad.exe`)
are unaffected. The guard is active under every generated launcher — systemd unit,
launchd plist, s6 run script and the Windows Scheduled Task — via the
`HERMES_SUPERVISED_CHILD` marker they export.

On macOS, executed `launchctl submit` and `launchctl bootstrap` commands are
restricted **regardless of the job label**. This is a conservative registration
restriction intended to catch indirect restart helpers with neutral labels, not
an inspection of the target plist. It also rejects independent scheduled jobs
with `RunAtLoad=false` and no `KeepAlive` key; rejection does **not** establish that
the job uses KeepAlive or controls Hermes.

For authorized LaunchAgent maintenance, use a separate shell outside the running
gateway. Some independent `load`/`unload` commands currently pass the label-based
checks, but that is not a target-verified exemption or a supported way to evade a
`bootstrap` rejection. Read-only `launchctl print` is not a lifecycle operation.
After external maintenance, distinguish the on-disk plist from the loaded job:
validate the plist and read back the loaded schedule before reporting activation.

A tool rejection means the command did not execute through that tool call. An
assistant declining to issue a call is a separate model decision; changing models
does not change the terminal guard's policy.

### Hardline Blocklist (Always-On Floor)

Some commands are so catastrophic — irreversible filesystem wipes, fork bombs, direct block-device writes — that Hermes refuses to run them **regardless** of:

- `--yolo` / `/yolo` toggled on
- `approvals.mode: off`
- Cron jobs running in headless `approve` mode
- User explicitly clicking "allow always"

The blocklist is the floor below `--yolo`. It trips **before** the approval layer even sees the command, and there's no override flag. Patterns currently covered (not exhaustive; kept in sync with `tools/approval.py::UNRECOVERABLE_BLOCKLIST`):

| Pattern | Why it's hardline |
|---|---|
| `rm -rf /` and obvious variants | Wipes the filesystem root |
| `rm -rf --no-preserve-root /` | The explicit "yes I mean root" variant |
| `:(){ :\|:& };:` (bash fork bomb) | Pegs the host until reboot |
| `mkfs.*` on a mounted root device | Formats the live system |
| `dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sd*` | Zeroes a physical disk |
| Piping untrusted URLs to `sh` at the rootfs top level | Remote-code-execution attack vector too broad to approve |

If you hit the blocklist, the tool call returns an explanatory error to the agent and nothing runs. If a legitimate workflow needs one of these commands (you're the operator of a wipe-and-reinstall pipeline, for example), run it outside the agent.

The floor also fails closed on a command whose shell quoting cannot be parsed (`grep 'unterminated`): the error says `malformed executable payload`. Quoting is judged on the command exactly as written, so shell-valid escapes inside a quoted pattern (`grep -o "[^\"]*" file`) are not malformed, and an escaped quote before a separator (`echo "a\"b"; reboot`) does not hide the command that follows it.

### User-Defined Deny Rules (`approvals.deny`)

The hardline blocklist is fixed and code-shipped. `approvals.deny` is its user-editable counterpart: a list of glob patterns that block matching terminal commands unconditionally — **before** `--yolo`, `/yolo`, and `approvals.mode: off` are consulted. Use it to run yolo-with-exceptions: "let the agent do everything, except these specific things, ever."

```yaml
approvals:
  deny:
    - "git push --force*"
    - "*curl*|*sh*"
    - "dd if=* of=/dev/*"
```

Details:

- Patterns are [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) globs (`*`, `?`, `[...]`) matched **case-insensitively** against the whole command text and individual executable-command candidates. `git push --force*` matches `git push --force origin main` but not `git push origin main`.
- Matching runs over the same normalized/deobfuscated command variants the dangerous-pattern detector uses, so simple quoting tricks (`git pu""sh --force`) don't slip past a rule.
- Executable candidates retain the literal path and also match its basename: `sudo *` covers `/usr/bin/sudo -n id` and `./sudo -n id`. A path-specific rule such as `/usr/bin/sudo *` does **not** become a rule for every binary named `sudo`.
- Quote-aware parsing exposes commands after assignments, leading redirections, `;`, `&&`, `||`, pipelines, groups, command substitutions, and ordinary `if`/`then`/`else`/`do` transitions. Supported launchers include `sudo`, `env`, `command`, `exec`, `nohup`, `setsid`, `time`, `nice`, `timeout`, `stdbuf`, `ionice`, `chrt`, `taskset`, and `chroot`. Known option operands are skipped; `command -v`/`-V` lookups are not executions. Shell `-c` payloads are inspected recursively. Literal executable-and-argument strings in `env -S` / `--split-string` use GNU quoting and escapes (including `\_` word boundaries and `\c` termination), with the remaining command arguments appended; shell punctuation inside those arguments stays data unless an actual shell `-c` consumes it. `env -a` / `--argv0` values are arguments, not executable names. Shell and GNU split-string comments do not introduce executable candidates.
- In the additional executable candidates, whitespace **between** words is collapsed, but quoted argument content and argument paths are retained. An exact rule such as `git status` therefore also matches `env git\tstatus; echo done` (where `\t` represents a tab). Quoted mentions such as `echo 'sudo -n id'` are not promoted to commands. Existing whole-input globs such as `*sudo*` still intentionally match mentions anywhere.
- **YAML quoting:** always quote patterns. A bare leading `*` is a YAML alias and fails to parse; `{`, `!`, and `: ` have their own YAML meanings. Single quotes are safest for shell-ish content.
- User-defined deny rules apply to all terminal backends, including isolated containers, before any backend-specific approval shortcut.
- A denied command returns a BLOCKED error to the agent telling it not to retry or rephrase. Nothing runs.

Like the rest of the approval config, changes take effect immediately (the config cache is mtime-keyed) — no session restart needed.

:::note Threat model
Deny rules are a shell-command policy, not a complete shell interpreter or an OS capability sandbox. Normalization does not resolve arbitrary variables (including GNU `env -S` `${NAME}` expansion), aliases, functions, renamed binaries, scripts, interpreter programs, or every shell/launcher grammar (for example, case-pattern syntax, clustered launcher options, or options embedded inside an `env -S` string). Do not use a basename deny rule as a guarantee that a capability cannot be reached by other means. For containment, use OS permissions and an isolated backend with appropriately restricted mounts, credentials, and network access. This matching behavior does not change the configured approval mode or the empty-deny-list default.
:::

### Approval Timeout

When a dangerous command prompt appears, the user has a configurable amount of time to respond. If no response is given within the timeout, the command is **denied** by default (fail-closed).

An expired prompt cannot be reopened: the pending entry is discarded and the agent is told not to retry on its own within that turn. To run the operation after all, send a new message asking for it (for example "go ahead and run that now") — the agent issues a fresh tool call, which raises a fresh approval card, and a "once" approval applies only to that call. A timeout is not counted as a denial, so asking again is never penalized.

Configure the timeout in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
approvals:
  timeout: 300  # seconds (default: 300)
```

### What Triggers Approval

The following patterns trigger approval prompts (defined in `tools/approval.py`):

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `rm -r` / `rm --recursive` | Recursive delete |
| `rm ... /` | Delete in root path |
| `chmod 777/666` / `o+w` / `a+w` | World/other-writable permissions |
| `chmod --recursive` with unsafe perms | Recursive world/other-writable (long flag) |
| `chown -R root` / `chown --recursive root` | Recursive chown to root |
| `mkfs` | Format filesystem |
| `dd if=` | Disk copy |
| `> /dev/sd` | Write to block device |
| `DROP TABLE/DATABASE` | SQL DROP |
| `DELETE FROM` (without WHERE) | SQL DELETE without WHERE |
| `TRUNCATE TABLE` | SQL TRUNCATE |
| `> /etc/` | Overwrite system config |
| `systemctl stop/restart/disable/mask` | Stop/restart/disable system services |
| `kill -9 -1` | Kill all processes |
| `pkill -9` | Force kill processes |
| Fork bomb patterns | Fork bombs |
| `bash -c` / `sh -c` / `zsh -c` / `ksh -c` | Shell command execution via `-c` flag (including combined flags like `-lc`) |
| `python -e` / `perl -e` / `ruby -e` / `node -c` | Script execution via `-e`/`-c` flag |
| `curl ... \| sh` / `wget ... \| sh` | Pipe remote content to shell |
| `bash <(curl ...)` / `sh <(wget ...)` | Execute remote script via process substitution |
| `tee` to `/etc/`, `~/.ssh/`, `~/.hermes/.env` | Overwrite sensitive file via tee |
| `>` / `>>` to `/etc/`, `~/.ssh/`, `~/.hermes/.env` | Overwrite sensitive file via redirection |
| `xargs rm` | xargs with rm |
| `find -exec rm` / `find -delete` | Find with destructive actions |
| `cp`/`mv`/`install` to `/etc/` | Copy/move file into system config |
| `sed -i` / `sed --in-place` on `/etc/` | In-place edit of system config |
| `pkill`/`killall` hermes/gateway | Self-termination prevention |
| `gateway run` with `&`/`disown`/`nohup`/`setsid` | Prevents starting gateway outside service manager |
| `docker stop/kill/restart`, `docker compose down/stop/kill/restart` | Container lifecycle (also catches global flags and `docker-compose`) |
| `docker -H`/`--host`/`--context`, `DOCKER_HOST=`/`DOCKER_CONTEXT=` | Docker daemon redirect — the command targets a different (often remote) daemon |
| `docker context use` | Switches the default daemon for all future docker commands |
| `podman --remote`/`-r`/`--url`/`--connection`/`--identity`, `CONTAINER_HOST=` | Podman remote daemon redirect |

:::info
**Container bypass**: When running in `docker`, `singularity`, `modal`, `daytona`, or `vercel_sandbox` backends, dangerous command checks are **skipped** because the container itself is the security boundary. Destructive commands inside a container can't harm the host.
:::

### Approval Flow (CLI)

In the interactive CLI, dangerous commands show an inline approval prompt:

```
  ⚠️  DANGEROUS COMMAND: recursive delete
      rm -rf ~/old-project

      [o]nce  |  [s]ession  |  [a]lways  |  [d]eny

      Choice [o/s/a/D]:
```

The four options:

- **once** — allow this single execution
- **session** — allow this pattern for the rest of the session
- **always** — add to permanent allowlist (saved to `config.yaml`)
- **deny** (default) — block the command

### Approval Flow (Gateway/Messaging)

On messaging platforms, the agent sends the dangerous command details to the chat and waits for the user to reply:

- Reply **yes**, **y**, **approve**, **ok**, or **go** to approve
- Reply **no**, **n**, **deny**, or **cancel** to deny

The `HERMES_EXEC_ASK=1` environment variable is automatically set when running the gateway.

### Permanent Allowlist

Commands approved with "always" are saved to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Permanently allowed dangerous command patterns
command_allowlist:
  - rm
  - systemctl
```

These patterns are loaded at startup and silently approved in all future sessions.

Entries can be exact command text, a shell-style glob (`podman *`), or a
dangerous-pattern rule key such as `script execution via heredoc` (the key shown
in the approval prompt). Rule keys are honored on every surface, including
unattended ones: a cron job, `hermes chat -q` run or webhook session under
`cron_mode`/`single_query_mode`/`unattended_mode: deny` still runs a command whose
detected rule key is in `command_allowlist`, while Tirith content-security
findings on the same command continue to block it.

The setting must be a list of strings. Legacy installs that stored a list as a
quoted YAML/JSON string recover that list at load time and log a warning to
re-save it with `hermes config edit`. Other malformed values are ignored with
a warning; they never become per-character approvals. Loading does not rewrite
your configuration file.

:::tip
Use `hermes config edit` to review or remove patterns from your permanent allowlist.
:::

:::caution
The list is read when Hermes starts. A pattern you remove while a session is
already running stays approved in that session until it next writes the file
(the next time you answer `always` to a prompt) or you restart Hermes. If you
removed it for safety reasons, restart.
:::

### Mining Approval History (`hermes approvals suggest`)

Instead of answering the same prompt session after session, you can mine your
past approval decisions into allowlist proposals:

```bash
hermes approvals suggest            # dry run — prints a numbered proposal
hermes approvals suggest --apply 1,3  # merge picks into command_allowlist
hermes approvals suggest --json     # machine-readable output
```

The command scans the session database (`~/.hermes/state.db`) for
dangerous-classified commands that actually executed — i.e. commands you
approved — aggregates them into patterns (`git push *`, or the dangerous-class
key for compound commands), and ranks them by approval frequency:

```
Proposed command_allowlist additions (from approval history, last 90 days):

  1. git push *    — approved 14x
  2. docker restart/stop/kill (container lifecycle)    — approved 9x (class key)
```

Safety rules:

- **Nothing is ever applied automatically** — the default run is read-only;
  only an explicit `--apply N[,M...]` writes to `config.yaml`.
- **Destructive classes are never proposed**, no matter how often they were
  approved: recursive deletes, `sudo`, disk/device writes, credential and
  system-config edits, pipe-to-shell, SQL DROP/TRUNCATE, process kills, and
  every hardline class are excluded outright. `rm -rf build/` approved 100
  times still never yields an `rm` entry.
- Proposals already covered by your existing `command_allowlist` are skipped.
- **Credentials inside mined commands are masked** (`ghp_…`, `bot<id>:<token>`
  URLs, `KEY=value` assignments, bearer tokens) in both the printed `e.g.`
  examples and the `--json` payload, using the same redactor as terminal
  output. Masked text is never used as an allowlist pattern: a command whose
  glob would embed a credential (`TOKEN=… git …`) is proposed under its
  dangerous-class key instead. The session database itself still holds the
  command as it was executed.

Useful flags: `--days N` (history window, default 90), `--min-count N`
(minimum approvals to qualify, default 2), `--limit N`, and `--db PATH`.

## File Write Safety {#file-write-safety}

Before `write_file` or `patch` touches disk, Hermes checks the target path against a denylist and an optional sandbox. Blocked writes return an error to the agent immediately — **there is no approval prompt** and no way to override from the chat UI. The model may still claim the edit succeeded; when `display.file_mutation_verifier` is on (default), trust the [file-mutation verifier footer](./configuration.md#file-mutation-verifier) over the assistant's closing summary.

### Protected paths (always blocked)

These categories are always denied, even when `HERMES_WRITE_SAFE_ROOT` is unset:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| OS credential stores | `~/.ssh/` (keys, `authorized_keys`), `~/.aws/`, `~/.kube/`, `/etc/sudoers`, `~/.netrc` |
| Hermes secret stores | `.env`, `.anthropic_oauth.json`, `auth/google_oauth.json`, Bitwarden cache (`cache/bws_cache.json`, `cache/bws_cache.enc.json`), `vault/`, `browser-profile/`, `mcp-tokens/`, `pairing/` under HERMES_HOME (active profile and global root). Control files (`auth.json`, `config.yaml`, `webhook_subscriptions.json`) are read-denied but stay writable. |
| Windows NT/device-namespace paths | `\??\...`, `\\.\...`, `\\?\UNC\...`, `\\?\GLOBALROOT...` — rejected for both reads and writes on every platform. On Windows, merely *resolving* such a path (e.g. `\??\UNC\host\share`) triggers outbound SMB authentication and can leak the user's NTLM hash; the prefixes also bypass normal path normalization. Ordinary extended-length local paths (`\\?\C:\...`) and plain UNC shares (`\\server\share`) are unaffected. |

Project-local `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production` and `.envrc` files are **read-denied** anywhere on disk (the file tools refuse to read them) but remain writable: the agent can create or edit them for you, it just cannot read the values back.

Sensitive paths inside the safe root are still blocked — pointing `HERMES_WRITE_SAFE_ROOT` at `$HOME` does not allow writing `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

The `~` in the OS-credential rows means *every* home a write can land in, not just the process `HOME`: the OS user's real home, the profile home (`{HERMES_HOME}/home` under `TERMINAL_HOME_MODE=profile`, containers and spawned workers, where the process `HOME` is pinned), and named accounts (`~root/.ssh/authorized_keys`). An absolute path to the real home's `~/.aws/credentials` is denied even when the agent process runs with `HOME` pointed elsewhere.

Safe-root violations return `Write denied: '…' is outside HERMES_WRITE_SAFE_ROOT (…)`. Credential-path blocks use `Write denied: '…' is a protected system/credential file.`

**Exception — `~/.ssh/config` is approval-gated, not hard-blocked.** The SSH
*client config* holds no private-key material and editing it (host aliases,
`ProxyJump`, VS Code Remote-SSH targets) is a routine task, so `write_file` /
`patch` route it through the same approve-once/session/always prompt the
terminal tool already uses for `~/.ssh` writes — instead of the flat refusal
that used to apply. It can still carry `ProxyCommand` / `Match exec` directives
that run commands, so the write is never silent. Non-interactive callers (ACP
file bridge, background jobs with no human channel) fail closed. Private keys,
`authorized_keys`, and everything else under `~/.ssh/` remain hard-blocked.

### HERMES_WRITE_SAFE_ROOT (optional sandbox)

When set, `write_file` and `patch` may only target paths inside the listed directory prefix(es). Anything outside is **hard-blocked** — not routed through dangerous-command approval.

- Set automatically in the [official Docker image](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) (`HERMES_WRITE_SAFE_ROOT=/opt/data`)
- Supports multiple roots separated by `:` on Unix or `;` on Windows
- **Do not add to `~/.hermes/.env` casually.** If you set it to a project directory, the agent cannot write to `~/.hermes/cron/jobs.json`, profile skills, or other Hermes state outside that prefix

To allow both a workspace and Hermes home:

```bash
export HERMES_WRITE_SAFE_ROOT=/path/to/project:/home/you/.hermes
```

Unset the variable to restore unrestricted writes (subject to the protected-path denylist). Full reference: [HERMES_WRITE_SAFE_ROOT](../reference/environment-variables.md#hermes_write_safe_root).

### Cron and other Hermes state

Do not ask the agent to `patch` `~/.hermes/cron/jobs.json` directly. Use the `cronjob_manage` tool, [`hermes cron`](./features/cron.md), or `/cron` — they update the job store through the supported API. The same applies to other Hermes control files when write safety blocks direct edits.

:::note Defense-in-depth, not a hard boundary
Write guards apply to `write_file` and `patch` only, with one exception: the Windows NT/device-namespace row is also enforced on reads — `read_file`, `search_files`, `@file:`/`@folder:` context references and the ACP file bridge all refuse those paths on the raw string, before anything resolves them. The `terminal` tool runs as the same OS user and can still `cat` or overwrite denied paths via shell commands. The denylist reduces accidental damage and gives models a clear stop signal; it does not sandbox a hostile or compromised agent.
:::

## User Authorization (Gateway)

When running the messaging gateway, Hermes controls who can interact with the bot through a layered authorization system.

### Authorization Check Order

The `_is_user_authorized()` method checks in this order:

1. **Per-platform allow-all flag** (e.g., `DISCORD_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true`)
2. **DM pairing approved list** (users approved via pairing codes)
3. **Platform-specific allowlists** (e.g., `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=12345,67890`)
4. **Global allowlist** (`GATEWAY_ALLOWED_USERS=12345,67890`)
5. **Global allow-all** (`GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true`)
6. **Default: deny**

### Platform Allowlists

Set allowed user IDs as comma-separated values in `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
# Platform-specific allowlists
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789,987654321
DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS=111222333444555666
WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS=15551234567
SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS=U01ABC123

# Cross-platform allowlist (checked for all platforms)
GATEWAY_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789

# Per-platform allow-all (use with caution)
DISCORD_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true

# Global allow-all (use with extreme caution)
GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true
```

The global allow-all can also live in `config.yaml` as `gateway.allow_all_users: true` (or top-level `allow_all_users: true`); a true value is bridged to `GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` at gateway startup (re-derived on every config load and restart, so flipping it back to `false` closes the gate), an explicit env var wins, and the gateway logs a warning naming `config.yaml` as the grant source. In a multi-profile gateway a secondary profile sets `GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` in its own `.env` (its `config.yaml` is never bridged into the process environment).

:::warning
If **no allowlists are configured** and `GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` is not set, **all users are denied**. The gateway logs a warning at startup:

```
No user allowlists configured. All unauthorized users will be denied.
Set GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true in ~/.hermes/.env to allow open access,
or configure platform allowlists (e.g., TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=your_id).

### DM Pairing System

For more flexible authorization, Hermes includes a code-based pairing system. Instead of requiring user IDs upfront, unknown users receive a one-time pairing code that the bot owner approves via the CLI.

**How it works:**

1. An unknown user sends a DM to the bot
2. The bot replies with an 8-character pairing code
3. The bot owner runs `hermes pairing approve <platform> <code>` on the CLI
4. The user is permanently approved for that platform

Control how unauthorized direct messages are handled in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
unauthorized_dm_behavior: pair

whatsapp:
  unauthorized_dm_behavior: ignore
```

- `pair` is the default for chat-style DM platforms. Unauthorized DMs get a pairing code reply.
- `ignore` silently drops unauthorized DMs.
- `decline` sends one short, polite decline ("I can only chat with my owner") instead of a pairing code, then ignores further messages from that sender for 24 hours. Customize the text with `unauthorized_dm_decline_message`.
- Email defaults to `ignore` unless `platforms.email.unauthorized_dm_behavior: pair` is set, because inboxes can contain unrelated unread mail.
- Platform sections override the global default, so you can keep pairing on Telegram while keeping WhatsApp silent.

**Security features** (based on OWASP + NIST SP 800-63-4 guidance):

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Code format | 8-char from 32-char unambiguous alphabet (no 0/O/1/I) |
| Randomness | Cryptographic (`secrets.choice()`) |
| Code TTL | 1 hour expiry |
| Rate limiting | 1 request per user per 10 minutes |
| Pending limit | Max 3 pending codes per platform |
| Lockout | 5 failed approval attempts → 1-hour lockout |
| File security | `chmod 0600` on all pairing data files |
| Logging | Codes are never logged to stdout |

**Pairing CLI commands:**

```bash
# List pending and approved users
hermes pairing list

# Approve a pairing code
hermes pairing approve telegram ABC12DEF

# Revoke a user's access
hermes pairing revoke telegram 123456789

# Clear all pending codes
hermes pairing clear-pending
```

:::tip Docker users: run pairing commands as the `hermes` user
The official Docker image runs the gateway as the unprivileged `hermes` user
(uid 10000) via `gosu`, but `docker exec` defaults to root. Approval files
created by root are written with mode `0600 root:root` and the gateway
cannot read them — the approval is silently ignored ([#10270][i10270]).

Always pass `-u hermes`:

```bash
docker exec -u hermes hermes-agent hermes pairing approve telegram ABC12DEF
```

If you already ran the command as root and the user is still unauthorized,
restart the container — the entrypoint will fix ownership on the next start.

[i10270]: https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/issues/10270
:::

**Storage:** Pairing data is stored in `~/.hermes/pairing/` with per-platform JSON files:
- `{platform}-pending.json` — pending pairing requests
- `{platform}-approved.json` — approved users
- `_rate_limits.json` — rate limit and lockout tracking

## Container Isolation

When using the `docker` terminal backend, Hermes applies strict security hardening to every container.

### Docker Security Flags

Every container runs with these flags (defined in `tools/environments/docker.py`):

```python
_BASE_SECURITY_ARGS = [
    "--cap-drop", "ALL",                          # Drop ALL Linux capabilities
    "--cap-add", "DAC_OVERRIDE",                  # Root can write to bind-mounted dirs
    "--cap-add", "CHOWN",                         # Package managers need file ownership
    "--cap-add", "FOWNER",                        # Package managers need file ownership
    "--security-opt", "no-new-privileges",         # Block privilege escalation
    "--pids-limit", "256",                         # Limit process count
    # no-tmp: ok — configures the sandbox's own tmpfs
    "--tmpfs", "/tmp:rw,nosuid,size=512m",         # Size-limited /tmp
    "--tmpfs", "/var/tmp:rw,noexec,nosuid,size=256m",  # No-exec /var/tmp
]
```

`SETUID`/`SETGID` are **not** in the base list — they're added conditionally when the container starts as root and an init/entrypoint must drop privileges (the s6 privilege-drop path). They're skipped when the container already runs as a non-root `--user`. The `/run` tmpfs is also split out from the base list and mounted per-image (hardened `noexec` by default, `exec` only for s6-overlay images that exec from `/run`).

### Resource Limits

Container resources are configurable in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
terminal:
  backend: docker
  docker_image: "nikolaik/python-nodejs:python3.11-nodejs20"
  docker_forward_env: []  # Explicit allowlist only; empty keeps secrets out of the container
  container_cpu: 1        # CPU cores
  container_memory: 5120  # MB (default 5GB)
  container_disk: 51200   # MB (default 50GB, requires overlay2 on XFS)
  container_persistent: true  # Persist filesystem across sessions
```

### Filesystem Persistence

- **Persistent mode** (`container_persistent: true`): Bind-mounts `/workspace` and `/root` from `~/.hermes/sandboxes/docker/<task_id>/`
- **Ephemeral mode** (`container_persistent: false`): Uses tmpfs for workspace — everything is lost on cleanup

:::tip
For production gateway deployments, use `docker`, `modal`, `daytona`, or `vercel_sandbox` backend to isolate agent commands from your host system. This eliminates the need for dangerous command approval entirely.
:::

:::warning
If you add names to `terminal.docker_forward_env`, those variables are intentionally injected into the container for terminal commands. This is useful for task-specific credentials like `GITHUB_TOKEN`, but it also means code running in the container can read and exfiltrate them.
:::

## Terminal Backend Security Comparison

| Backend | Isolation | Dangerous Cmd Check | Best For |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| **local** | None — runs on host | ✅ Yes | Development, trusted users |
| **ssh** | Remote machine | ✅ Yes | Running on a separate server |
| **docker** | Container | ❌ Skipped (container is boundary) | Production gateway |
| **singularity** | Container | ❌ Skipped | HPC environments |
| **modal** | Cloud sandbox | ❌ Skipped | Scalable cloud isolation |
| **daytona** | Cloud sandbox | ❌ Skipped | Persistent cloud workspaces |
| **vercel_sandbox** | Cloud microVM | ❌ Skipped | Cloud execution with snapshot persistence |

## Environment Variable Passthrough {#environment-variable-passthrough}

Both `execute_code` and `terminal` strip sensitive environment variables from child processes to prevent credential exfiltration by LLM-generated code. However, skills that declare `required_environment_variables` legitimately need access to those vars.

First-party platform credentials — the `BUZZ_*` variables used by the Buzz messaging platform — are passed through to `terminal` children (foreground and background/PTY spawns) **only when the session is actually operating as a Buzz agent**: the process is a Buzz-ACP managed agent (`BUZZ_MANAGED_AGENT` set by the Buzz Desktop harness) or the live gateway session's platform is `buzz`. This lets a Buzz platform agent invoke its platform-mandated CLI (e.g. `buzz`) from the terminal tool, while Telegram/CLI/cron sessions on the same host keep the variables stripped. Because `_sanitize_subprocess_env` also feeds search workers (e.g. the ddgs web-search subprocess), the computer-use driver binary, and user-script runners (bang `!` commands, quick commands, cron scripts, webhook-filter scripts), those children receive the variables too when spawned from a Buzz session. The carve-out is **terminal-only**: it does not apply to `execute_code`, browser/TUI-host spawns (`hermes_subprocess_env`), Docker/Modal children, or `env_passthrough` registration, which remain sealed.

### How It Works

Two mechanisms allow specific variables through the sandbox filters:

**1. Skill-scoped passthrough (automatic)**

When a skill is loaded (via `skill_view` or the `/skill` command) and declares `required_environment_variables`, any of those vars that are actually set in the environment are automatically registered as passthrough. Missing vars (still in setup-needed state) are **not** registered.

```yaml
# In a skill's SKILL.md frontmatter
required_environment_variables:
  - name: TENOR_API_KEY
    prompt: Tenor API key
    help: Get a key from https://developers.google.com/tenor
```

After loading this skill, `TENOR_API_KEY` passes through to `execute_code`, `terminal` (local), **and remote backends (Docker, Modal)** — no manual configuration needed.

:::info Docker & Modal
Prior to v0.5.1, Docker's `forward_env` was a separate system from the skill passthrough. They are now merged — skill-declared env vars are automatically forwarded into Docker containers and Modal sandboxes without needing to add them to `docker_forward_env` manually.
:::

**2. Config-based passthrough (manual)**

For env vars not declared by any skill, add them to `terminal.env_passthrough` in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
terminal:
  env_passthrough:
    - MY_CUSTOM_KEY
    - ANOTHER_TOKEN
```

Both lists apply to `terminal`, `execute_code` and `no_agent` cron scripts alike. A declared variable is forwarded with the value of the profile the child runs for: when one process serves several profiles (multi-profile gateway, Desktop/dashboard backend) each profile's declared value comes from its own `.env` / secret sources, never from the process environment the launch profile populated, and the launch profile's `.env` credentials are dropped from a served profile's children.

### Credential File Passthrough (OAuth tokens, etc.) {#credential-file-passthrough}

Some skills need **files** (not just env vars) in the sandbox — for example, Google Workspace stores OAuth tokens as `google_token.json` under the active profile's `HERMES_HOME`. Skills declare these in frontmatter:

```yaml
required_credential_files:
  - path: google_token.json
    description: Google OAuth2 token (created by setup script)
  - path: google_client_secret.json
    description: Google OAuth2 client credentials
```

When loaded, Hermes checks if these files exist in the active profile's `HERMES_HOME` and registers them for mounting:

- **Docker**: Read-only bind mounts (`-v host:container:ro`)
- **Modal**: Mounted at sandbox creation + synced before each command (handles mid-session OAuth setup)
- **Local**: No action needed (files already accessible)

You can also list credential files manually in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
terminal:
  credential_files:
    - google_token.json
    - my_custom_oauth_token.json
```

Paths are relative to `~/.hermes/`. Files are mounted to `/root/.hermes/` inside the container. This list is read by `tools/credential_files.py` (`terminal.credential_files`) — it lives under the `terminal:` block but is loaded by the credential-files module, not the core terminal backend, so it isn't part of the bundled `DEFAULT_CONFIG` snapshot.

### Borrowed CLI logins (Codex CLI, Claude Code) {#borrowed-cli-logins}

When Hermes has no usable login of its own for `openai-codex` or `anthropic`, it can borrow the Codex CLI's `~/.codex/auth.json` and Claude Code's `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (or Keychain entry) and refresh them on your behalf. Both use single-use, rotating refresh tokens: once two programs hold one token family, whichever refreshes first invalidates the other's copy, which shows up as "I logged in once in the terminal and Hermes keeps failing" (or the reverse). If you run those CLIs alongside Hermes, give Hermes its own login and turn adoption off:

```yaml
auth:
  adopt_external_logins: false   # default: true
```

With the switch off Hermes never reads or refreshes those files: the `claude_code` credential-pool row disappears, `hermes auth list` prints one line saying so, and the log carries one INFO line per process. Only automatic adoption is affected — `hermes auth add openai-codex` still asks before importing an existing Codex CLI login. Automatic recovery also only repairs the credential Hermes already holds: a Codex CLI/Desktop login into a different ChatGPT workspace is refused with a warning (re-authenticate with `hermes auth add openai-codex`), and a login you complete while recovery is running is never overwritten. Add your own logins with `hermes auth add anthropic` / `hermes auth add openai-codex`.

### What Each Sandbox Filters

| Sandbox | Default Filter | Passthrough Override |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **execute_code** | Blocks vars containing `KEY`, `TOKEN`, `SECRET`, `PASSWORD`, `CREDENTIAL`, `PASSWD`, `AUTH` in name; only allows safe-prefix vars through | ✅ Passthrough vars bypass both checks |
| **terminal** (local) | Blocks explicit Hermes infrastructure vars (provider keys, gateway tokens, tool API keys) | ✅ Passthrough vars bypass the blocklist |
| **terminal** (Docker) | No host env vars by default | ✅ Passthrough vars + `docker_forward_env` forwarded via `-e` |
| **terminal** (SSH) | No host env vars by default | ✅ Passthrough vars forwarded via `SendEnv`; the remote `sshd_config` needs a matching `AcceptEnv` (see [SSH backend](configuration.md#ssh-backend)) |
| **terminal** (Modal) | No host env/files by default | ✅ Credential files mounted; env passthrough via sync |
| **MCP** | Blocks everything except safe system vars + explicitly configured `env` | ❌ Not affected by passthrough (use MCP `env` config instead) |

### Security Considerations

- The passthrough only affects vars you or your skills explicitly declare — the default security posture is unchanged for arbitrary LLM-generated code
- Credential files are mounted **read-only** into Docker containers
- Skills Guard scans skill content for suspicious env access patterns before installation
- Missing/unset vars are never registered (you can't leak what doesn't exist)
- Hermes infrastructure secrets (provider API keys, gateway tokens) should never be added to `env_passthrough` — they have dedicated mechanisms

## MCP Credential Handling

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server subprocesses receive a **filtered environment** to prevent accidental credential leakage.

### Safe Environment Variables

Only these variables are passed through from the host to MCP stdio subprocesses:

```
PATH, HOME, USER, LANG, LC_ALL, TERM, SHELL, TMPDIR
```

Plus any `XDG_*` variables. All other environment variables (API keys, tokens, secrets) are **stripped**.

Variables explicitly defined in the MCP server's `env` config are passed through:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  github:
    command: "npx"
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    env:
      GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: "ghp_..."  # Only this is passed
```

### Credential Redaction

Error messages from MCP tools are sanitized before being returned to the LLM. The following patterns are replaced with `[REDACTED]`:

- GitHub PATs (`ghp_...`)
- OpenAI-style keys (`sk-...`)
- Bearer tokens
- `token=`, `key=`, `API_KEY=`, `password=`, `secret=` parameters

### Website Access Policy

You can restrict which websites the agent can access through its web and browser tools. This is useful for preventing the agent from accessing internal services, admin panels, or other sensitive URLs.

```yaml
# In ~/.hermes/config.yaml
security:
  website_blocklist:
    enabled: true
    domains:
      - "*.internal.company.com"
      - "admin.example.com"
    shared_files:
      - "/etc/hermes/blocked-sites.txt"
```

When a blocked URL is requested, the tool returns an error explaining the domain is blocked by policy. The blocklist is enforced across `web_search`, `web_extract`, `browser_navigate`, and all URL-capable tools.

See [Website Blocklist](./configuration.md#website-blocklist) in the configuration guide for full details.

### SSRF Protection

All URL-capable tools (web search, web extract, vision, browser) validate URLs before fetching them to prevent Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. Blocked addresses include:

- **Private networks** (RFC 1918): `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`
- **Loopback**: `127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`
- **Link-local**: `169.254.0.0/16` (includes cloud metadata at `169.254.169.254`)
- **CGNAT / shared address space** (RFC 6598): `100.64.0.0/10` (Tailscale, WireGuard VPNs)
- **Cloud metadata hostnames**: `metadata.google.internal`, `metadata.goog`
- **Reserved, multicast, and unspecified addresses**

SSRF protection is always active for internet-facing use and DNS failures are treated as blocked (fail-closed). Redirect chains are re-validated at each hop to prevent redirect-based bypasses.

The same guard covers fetches whose URL comes from a remote party rather than from you: image/video URLs returned by a generation provider, reference-image URLs a model supplies for edits, pet spritesheets and the petdex manifest, and skills.sh sitemap entries. A provider or index that points one of those at a private or metadata address is refused before any connection opens; the operator's own provider `base_url` is not affected — a download fetched directly from your configured `base_url` (the OpenRouter video content endpoint) skips only the private-address class check on that first hop, while the cloud-metadata floor still applies and any redirect it issues is re-validated in full — and an image-generation provider hosted on your LAN needs `security.allow_private_urls: true` (below) for the *result* URLs it returns to be cached locally.

#### Intentionally allowing private URLs

Some setups legitimately need private/internal URL access — home networks that resolve `home.arpa` to RFC 1918 space, LAN-only Ollama/llama.cpp endpoints, internal wikis, cloud metadata debugging, and the like. For those cases there's a global opt-out:

```yaml
security:
  allow_private_urls: true   # default: false
```

When on, web tools, the browser, vision URL fetches, and gateway media downloads no longer reject RFC 1918 / loopback / link-local / CGNAT / cloud-metadata destinations. **This is a deliberate trust boundary** — only enable it on machines where the agent running arbitrary prompt-injected URLs against the local network is an acceptable risk. Public-facing gateways should leave it off.

The host-substring guard (which blocks lookalike Unicode domain tricks even when the underlying IP is public) stays on regardless of this setting.

#### Local proxy fake-ip ranges

A TUN proxy in fake-ip mode (Mihomo/Clash `fake-ip`, Surge enhanced mode) answers DNS with an
address from its own block — `198.18.0.0/15` (RFC 2544 benchmarking) by default — for every name
outside its filter. Those answers are the proxy's sentinel, not an internal host, so the
private-IP guard otherwise rejects every outbound fetch on such a host: `web_extract`, platform
attachment downloads and the browser relay all fail with *URL targets a private or internal
network address* while the request never reaches the network. Declare the block to let the
sentinel through:

```yaml
security:
  fake_ip_ranges:
    - 198.18.0.0/15
```

Empty by default, and narrower than `allow_private_urls`: only the declared blocks get the
exemption, they should be ranges the local proxy owns (the dial still goes to the proxy, which
resolves the real target itself), and loopback, RFC 1918, link-local, CGNAT and cloud-metadata
destinations stay blocked — an entry that overlaps one of those classes (including `0.0.0.0/0`
or `::/0`) is ignored with a warning rather than widening the guard. On a host with a cloud
browser provider, the declared sentinel also stops counting as private for
`browser.auto_local_for_private_urls`, so those pages keep going to the cloud browser.

### Tirith Pre-Exec Security Scanning

Hermes integrates [tirith](https://github.com/sheeki03/tirith) for content-level command scanning before execution. Tirith detects threats that pattern matching alone misses:

- Homograph URL spoofing (internationalized domain attacks)
- Pipe-to-interpreter patterns (`curl | bash`, `wget | sh`)
- Terminal injection attacks

Tirith auto-installs from GitHub releases on first use with SHA-256 checksum verification (and cosign provenance verification if cosign is available).

```yaml
# In ~/.hermes/config.yaml
security:
  tirith_enabled: true       # Enable/disable tirith scanning (default: true)
  tirith_path: "tirith"      # Path to tirith binary (default: PATH lookup)
  tirith_timeout: 5          # Subprocess timeout in seconds
  tirith_fail_open: true     # Allow execution when tirith is unavailable (default: true)
```

When `tirith_fail_open` is `true` (default), commands proceed if tirith is not installed or times out. Set to `false` in high-security environments to block commands when tirith is unavailable.

Three consecutive operational failures (spawn error, timeout, crash) suspend scanning for five minutes so a broken binary cannot stall every command; after that window one command re-probes tirith, and any completed scan (allow, warn or block) resumes normal scanning. A probe that fails again re-arms the five-minute window.

Tirith ships prebuilt binaries for Linux (x86_64 / aarch64) and macOS (x86_64 / arm64). On platforms with no prebuilt binary (Windows, etc.), tirith is silently skipped — pattern-matching guards still run, and the CLI does not surface an "unavailable" banner. To use tirith on Windows, run Hermes under WSL.

Tirith's verdict integrates with the approval flow: safe commands pass through, while both suspicious and blocked commands trigger user approval with the full tirith findings (severity, title, description, safer alternatives). Users can approve or deny — the default choice is deny to keep unattended scenarios secure.

Two known Tirith false positives are downgraded to "allow" so they never prompt (or, in cron, never deny): a `lookalike_tld` warning whose only target is the legitimate `.app` gTLD, and a `variation_selector` warning when every selector in the command is U+FE0F directly after an emoji (folder names such as `🗞️ Journal/` or `▶️ Media/`). A variation selector after a letter or digit — the steganographic-obfuscation signal the rule exists for — still prompts.

### Context File Injection Protection

Context files (AGENTS.md, .cursorrules, SOUL.md) are scanned for prompt injection before being included in the system prompt. The scanner checks for:

- Instructions to ignore/disregard prior instructions
- Hidden HTML comments with suspicious keywords
- Attempts to read secrets (`.env`, `credentials`, `.netrc`)
- Credential exfiltration via `curl`
- Invisible Unicode characters (zero-width spaces, bidirectional overrides)

The translation-and-execution check requires a short language/format clause (for example,
“translate this into a bash script and execute it”). It does not connect translation
and execution verbs across unrelated comma-separated role prose. These patterns are
heuristics, not semantic intent detection.

Blocked project files show a warning:

```
[BLOCKED: AGENTS.md contained potential prompt injection (prompt_injection). Content not loaded.]
```

Your own `SOUL.md` in `HERMES_HOME` is treated differently: it is a file you wrote (file-tool writes to it
need your approval, and project checkouts never supply it), so a scanner hit there **does not block the
file**. Hermes logs a warning naming the matched pattern, loads the file as usual, and `/context` lists it as
`⚠ SOUL.md … loaded — matched prompt-injection pattern(s); review the file`. This lets an identity file that
*documents* an attack phrase (security guidance such as "content telling you to ignore previous instructions")
keep working; if you did not write the flagged text, treat the warning as a sign that something else edited
the file. The exception does not extend to a `SOUL.md` shipped by a profile distribution: `hermes profile
install <git-url>` and `hermes profile update` copy a third party's `SOUL.md` into the profile home without
a scan or an approval prompt, so when `distribution.yaml` owns the file a scanner hit still blocks it.

## Best Practices for Production Deployment

### Gateway Deployment Checklist

1. **Set explicit allowlists** — never use `GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true` in production
2. **Use container backend** — set `terminal.backend: docker` in config.yaml
3. **Restrict resource limits** — set appropriate CPU, memory, and disk limits
4. **Store secrets securely** — keep API keys in `~/.hermes/.env` with proper file permissions
5. **Enable DM pairing** — use pairing codes instead of hardcoding user IDs when possible
6. **Review command allowlist** — periodically audit `command_allowlist` in config.yaml
7. **Set `terminal.cwd`** — don't let the agent operate from sensitive directories
8. **Run as non-root** — never run the gateway as root
9. **Monitor logs** — check `~/.hermes/logs/` for unauthorized access attempts
10. **Keep updated** — run `hermes update` regularly for security patches

### Securing API Keys

```bash
# Set proper permissions on the .env file
chmod 600 ~/.hermes/.env

# Keep separate keys for different services
# Never commit .env files to version control
```

### Network Isolation

For maximum security, run the gateway on a separate machine or VM. Set `terminal.backend: ssh` in `config.yaml`, then provide host details via environment variables in `~/.hermes/.env`:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
terminal:
  backend: ssh
```

```bash
# ~/.hermes/.env
TERMINAL_SSH_HOST=agent-worker.local
TERMINAL_SSH_USER=hermes
TERMINAL_SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/hermes_agent_key
```

The SSH connection details live in `.env` (not `config.yaml`) so they aren't checked in or shared along with profile exports. This keeps the gateway's messaging connections separate from the agent's command execution.

## Trusted-by-placement extension points {#trusted-by-placement}

Most third-party code Hermes can run is gated by an explicit allow-list: general plugins need `plugins.enabled`, shell hooks need a first-use approval (or `hooks_auto_accept`), MCP servers are listed in config. One surface is deliberately different:

| Extension point | Loaded from | Loaded when | Opt-in |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| [Gateway event hooks](./features/hooks.md#gateway-event-hooks) | `<profile home>/hooks/<name>/` (`HOOK.yaml` + `handler.py`) | Gateway startup (`HookRegistry.discover_and_load()`), per served profile | **Placing the directory.** No `plugins.enabled` entry, no prompt; `HERMES_SAFE_MODE` does not skip it. |

The gateway imports every valid hook directory in-process, with the gateway's own privileges. This is the documented contract (since `3988c3c245f`), not an oversight: the profile home is operator-owned configuration, and anyone who can write into it can already run code as you through `config.yaml` shell hooks or by editing `plugins.enabled`, so a separate consent gate for `hooks/` would add friction without moving the trust boundary. Treat the contents of `~/.hermes/hooks/` like the contents of `config.yaml` — review a `handler.py` before you place it, and include `ls ~/.hermes/hooks/` whenever you audit the rest of the profile home (the directory is not on the [protected-paths denylist](#file-write-safety), so it is ordinary writable state). Full details: [gateway hook trust model](./features/hooks.md#gateway-hook-trust).

## Supply-chain advisory checking

Hermes ships with a built-in advisory scanner that flags Python packages in the active venv that match a curated catalog of known-compromised versions (supply-chain worms like the May 2026 `mistralai 2.4.6` poisoning). Implementation lives in `hermes_cli/security_advisories.py`.

How it runs:

- **CLI startup banner.** A one-line warning is printed if any advisory matches, with a pointer to `hermes doctor` for the full remediation.
- **`hermes doctor`.** Surfaces every active advisory with version specifics and 2-4 step remediation instructions.
- **Gateway startup.** Logged to `gateway.log`; the first interactive message gets a short operator banner.

Each advisory carries a stable id. Once you have read and acted on it you can dismiss it for good:

```bash
hermes doctor --ack <advisory-id>
```

The ack is persisted to `config.security.acked_advisories` and survives restart. Old advisories are intentionally **not** removed from the catalog — leaving them in place keeps fresh installs warned about historically poisoned versions that might still be cached in a private mirror.

The check itself is stdlib-only and runs from one `importlib.metadata.version()` lookup per advisory, so it's safe to run on every startup.

### Lazy install of optional dependencies

Many features (Mistral TTS, ElevenLabs, Honcho memory, Bedrock, Slack, Matrix, …) depend on Python packages that not every user needs. Hermes installs these **lazily** on first use rather than eagerly under `hermes-agent[all]`. The implementation lives in `tools/lazy_deps.py`.

The trade-off this fixes:

- **Fragility.** When one extra's transitive dependency becomes unavailable on PyPI (quarantined for malware, yanked, broken upload), the entire `[all]` resolve would fail and fresh installs would silently fall back to a stripped tier — losing 10+ unrelated extras at once. Lazy install isolates each backend so one poisoned dep can't break unrelated features.
- **Bloat.** A user who only ever talks to one provider no longer pulls hundreds of packages they will never import.

How it works:

1. A backend module calls `ensure("feature.name")` at the top of its first-import path.
2. If the deps are missing, `ensure` checks `security.allow_lazy_installs` in `config.yaml` (default `true`) and runs a venv-scoped `pip install` for the allowlisted specs.
3. If the install fails or the user has disabled lazy installs, the call raises `FeatureUnavailable` with the actual pip stderr and a pointer at `hermes tools`.

Security guarantees enforced by `tools/lazy_deps.py`:

| Guarantee | What it means |
|---|---|
| Venv-scoped only | Installs target `sys.executable` in the active venv — never the system Python |
| PyPI by name only | Specs accept `"package>=1.0,<2"` syntax. No `--index-url`, `git+https://`, or file: paths — a malicious `config.yaml` cannot redirect the install |
| Allowlist | Only specs that appear in the in-tree `LAZY_DEPS` map can be installed via this path. A typo in a feature name does NOT get install-anything semantics |
| Opt-out | Set `security.allow_lazy_installs: false` to disable runtime installs entirely. Useful for restricted networks or strict security postures |
| No silent retries | Failures surface as `FeatureUnavailable` — no caching of bad state, no retry storms |

To disable runtime installs:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
security:
  allow_lazy_installs: false
```

When disabled, backends that need optional deps will tell the user to run the install manually (`pip install …`) or pick a different backend via `hermes tools`.
