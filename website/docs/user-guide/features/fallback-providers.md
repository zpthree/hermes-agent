# Fallback Providers

Hermes Agent has three layers of resilience that keep your sessions running when providers hit issues:

1. **[Credential pools](./credential-pools.md)** — rotate across multiple API keys for the *same* provider (tried first)
2. **Primary model fallback** — automatically switches to a *different* provider:model when your main model fails
3. **Auxiliary task fallback** — independent provider resolution for side tasks like vision and compression

Credential pools handle same-provider rotation (e.g., multiple OpenRouter keys). This page covers cross-provider fallback. Both are optional and work independently.

## Primary Model Fallback

When your main LLM provider encounters errors — rate limits, server overload, auth failures, connection drops — Hermes can automatically switch to a backup provider:model pair mid-session without losing your conversation.

### Configuration

The easiest path is the interactive manager:

```bash
hermes fallback
```

`hermes fallback` reuses the provider picker from `hermes model` — same provider list, same credential prompts, same validation. Use the subcommands `add`, `list` (alias `ls`), `remove` (alias `rm`), and `clear` to manage the chain. Changes persist under the top-level `fallback_providers:` list in `config.yaml`.

If you'd rather edit the YAML directly, add a top-level `fallback_providers` list to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
fallback_providers:
  - provider: openrouter
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
```

Each entry requires both `provider` and `model`. Entries missing either field are ignored.

When a rate-limit response names its reset time, the primary is benched until exactly then (a provider that says nothing gets the exponential 60 s → 4 h backoff). Optionally, skip the switch when the primary reopens soon:

```yaml
fallback:
  min_switch_reset_seconds: 120   # 0 (default) = always switch
```

| Key | Default | Effect |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `fallback.min_switch_reset_seconds` | `0` (off) | A rate-limited primary whose declared reset is sooner than this many seconds is not swapped for a fallback; the retry backoff waits out the window instead. |

Gemini fallback entries accept `gemini`, `google`, `google-gemini`, and
`google-ai-studio`. On Google's native API endpoint, all use the native Gemini
client, including its `generationConfig.thinkingConfig` translation. A custom
OpenAI-compatible base URL continues to use the compatible client instead.

:::note `fallback_model` vs `fallback_providers`
`fallback_providers` (plural, list) is the current config shape and supports multiple fallbacks tried in order. `fallback_model` (singular) is the legacy single-fallback key — Hermes still honors it for back-compat, but `hermes fallback` writes the current `fallback_providers` key and migrates legacy config on write. When both are set, `fallback_providers` takes priority.

| Mixture of Agents preset | `moa` (`model` = preset name) | A configured MoA preset whose aggregator has credentials — the fallback runs the whole preset (references + aggregator), not the aggregator alone |

### Custom Endpoint Fallback

For a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint, add `base_url` and optionally `key_env`:

```yaml
fallback_providers:
  - provider: custom
    model: my-local-model
    base_url: http://localhost:8000/v1
    key_env: MY_LOCAL_KEY            # env var name containing the API key
```

### When Fallback Triggers

The fallback activates automatically when the primary model fails with:

- **Rate limits** (HTTP 429) — after exhausting retry attempts
- **Server errors** (HTTP 500, 502, 503) — after exhausting retry attempts
- **Auth failures** (HTTP 401, 403) — immediately (no point retrying)
- **Not found** (HTTP 404) — immediately
- **Invalid responses** — when the API returns malformed or empty responses repeatedly. An HTTP-200 body whose only assistant text is a router's `Connect timeout, please try again later.` with zero completion tokens counts as invalid too (streamed or not, in the main loop, the iteration-limit summary and auxiliary calls), so it is retried instead of shown as the answer. A streamed refusal (the model declining with an explanation on the refusal channel) is a terminal `content_filter` result, not an empty response, so it is surfaced rather than retried. On the native Anthropic wire a `stop_reason: refusal` arrives with an empty body; Hermes reports the reason from the response's `stop_details` (category and, when present, explanation) in the refusal message and in the log line (`native_stop_reason=… stop_details=…`).

When triggered, Hermes:

1. Resolves credentials for the fallback provider (including named custom providers using `key_cmd`)
2. Builds a new API client, preserving a dynamic credential source across timeout and request-client rebuilds
3. Swaps the model, provider, and client in-place
4. Re-resolves the reasoning effort for the fallback model (its `agent.reasoning_overrides` entry, else the global `agent.reasoning_effort`)
5. Resets the retry counter and continues the conversation

The switch is seamless — your conversation history, tool calls, and context are preserved. The agent continues from exactly where it left off, just using a different model.

The same re-resolution happens when the CLI falls back at **startup** because the primary provider's auth fails before the first request: the fallback model is sent its own configured effort, not the primary's. An explicit `hermes chat --reasoning <level>` is kept across that startup switch — it is your intent for the run.

:::warning Fallback resets the prompt cache
Prompt caches are keyed to the model (and on most providers, the account) serving the request. When fallback fires, the new provider:model has no cached prefix for your conversation, so the next request re-reads the entire history at full input-token price instead of the ~75–90% discounted cached rate. The same applies when the turn ends and the primary is restored — that first request back on the primary is a full re-read too (unless the primary's cache TTL hasn't expired). This is unavoidable — it's the cost of staying alive through an outage — but it's why a long session that bounces between providers can cost noticeably more than one that stays put.
:::

:::info Per-Turn, Not Per-Session
Fallback is **turn-scoped**: each new user message starts with the primary model restored. If the primary fails mid-turn, fallback activates for that turn only. On the next message, Hermes tries the primary again. Within a single turn, fallback activates at most once — if the fallback also fails, normal error handling takes over (retries, then error message). This prevents cascading failover loops within a turn while giving the primary model a fresh chance every turn.

The per-turn retry is **reset-aware**: when the primary's credentials report a rate-limit reset time that hasn't elapsed yet (subscription windows like Claude Pro/Max's 5-hour blocks or Codex weekly limits report these as hours or days), Hermes skips the doomed retry and stays on the fallback until the reset passes — avoiding two pointless provider switches (and two prompt-cache invalidations) per turn. Expiry makes the primary eligible for a later retry; it does not schedule a retry or guarantee recovery. Transient 429s without a reset time use an exponential cooldown.

When a switch arms that cooldown, the fallback notice includes its approximate remaining duration, for example: `Primary retry eligible in ~60 s; recovery is not guaranteed.` Non-rate-limit switches and switches from an already-active cross-provider fallback do not announce a new primary cooldown.

### Examples

**OpenRouter as fallback for Anthropic native:**
```yaml
model:
  provider: anthropic
  default: claude-sonnet-4-6

fallback_providers:
  - provider: openrouter
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
```

**Nous Portal as fallback for OpenRouter:**
```yaml
model:
  provider: openrouter
  default: anthropic/claude-opus-4

fallback_providers:
  - provider: nous
    model: nous-hermes-3
```

**Local model as fallback for cloud:**
```yaml
fallback_providers:
  - provider: custom
    model: llama-3.1-70b
    base_url: http://localhost:8000/v1
    key_env: LOCAL_API_KEY
```

**Codex OAuth as fallback:**
```yaml
fallback_providers:
  - provider: openai-codex
    model: gpt-5.4
```

### Where Fallback Works

| Context | Fallback Supported |
|---------|-------------------|
| CLI sessions (interactive and `hermes -z` one-shot) | ✔ (at startup when the primary's credentials/quota fail, mid-session, and a chain added or edited while a chat is open applies from its next turn) |
| Messaging gateway (Telegram, Discord, etc.) | ✔ |
| Desktop app / TUI chats | ✔ (a chain added or edited while a chat is open applies from its next turn) |
| Subagent delegation | ✔ (`delegation.fallback_providers` when set; otherwise only unpinned children inherit the parent chain; `[]` disables) |
| Cron jobs | ✔ (unpinned jobs inherit the configured chain; a job with its own provider/model/base_url never falls back to it) |
| Auxiliary tasks on `provider: auto` | ✔ (try per-task fallback, then the main fallback chain before built-in aux discovery) |

:::tip
There are no environment variables for the primary fallback chain — configure it exclusively through `config.yaml` or `hermes fallback`. This is intentional: fallback configuration is a deliberate choice, not something a stale shell export should override.
:::

---

## Auxiliary Task Fallback

Hermes uses separate lightweight models for side tasks. Each task has its own provider resolution chain that acts as a built-in fallback system.

### Tasks with Independent Provider Resolution

| Task | What It Does | Config Key |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Vision | Image analysis, browser screenshots | `auxiliary.vision` |
| Compression | Context compression summaries | `auxiliary.compression` |
| Skills Hub | Skill search and discovery | `auxiliary.skills_hub` |
| MCP | MCP helper operations | `auxiliary.mcp` |
| Approval | Smart command-approval classification | `auxiliary.approval` |
| Title Generation | Session title summaries | `auxiliary.title_generation` |
| Review | `/review` reviewer subagent (full agent, not a single LLM call) | `auxiliary.review` |
| Triage Specifier | `hermes kanban specify` / dashboard ✨ button — fleshes out a one-liner triage task into a real spec | `auxiliary.triage_specifier` |

### Auto-Detection Chain

When a task's provider is set to `"auto"` (the default), Hermes first tries the main provider + main model for that auxiliary task. If that route is unavailable or later fails with a capacity-style error, Hermes follows your configured fallback policy and then stops:

```text
Main provider + main model → auxiliary.<task>.fallback_chain →
fallback_providers / fallback_model → skip the task (warn)
```

A billing or quota failure quarantines only the failed custom endpoint for the auxiliary health cooldown, not every route registered as `custom`. A healthy local endpoint with a different base URL remains eligible for fallback and subsequent auto routing. Aliases for the same custom endpoint share its health state. Built-in providers retain their shared-account health checks.

The task-specific chain is most precise and wins when present. The top-level `fallback_providers` chain is the same policy the main agent uses, so free-only or same-provider fallback rules apply to auxiliary tasks on `auto` as well.

**Built-in text discovery chain (compression, web extract, title generation, etc.):**

```text
OpenRouter → Nous Portal → Custom endpoint → Codex OAuth →
API-key providers (z.ai, Kimi, MiniMax, Xiaomi MiMo, Hugging Face, Anthropic) → give up
```

**Built-in vision discovery chain:**

```text
Main provider (if vision-capable) → OpenRouter → Nous Portal →
Codex OAuth → Anthropic → Custom endpoint → give up
```

Those built-in chains run **only when no main provider is selected** (`model.provider: auto` or unset). Once you have picked a main provider, an unavailable main route with no `fallback_chain` / `fallback_providers` skips the auxiliary task with a warning instead of guessing another provider you happen to be logged into — an expired xAI or Codex session must never bill your Nous Portal or OpenRouter balance behind your back. Declare a fallback if you want one.

### Configuring Auxiliary Providers

Each task can be configured independently in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
auxiliary:
  vision:
    provider: "auto"              # auto | openrouter | nous | codex | main | anthropic
    model: ""                     # e.g. "openai/gpt-4o"
    base_url: ""                  # direct endpoint (takes precedence over provider)
    api_key: ""                   # API key for base_url

  compression:
    provider: "auto"
    model: ""
    fallback_chain:              # optional, task-specific fallback policy
      - provider: openrouter
        model: inclusionai/ring-2.6-1t:free

  skills_hub:
    provider: "auto"
    model: ""

  mcp:
    provider: "auto"
    model: ""
```

Every task above follows the same **provider / model / base_url** pattern. Each task can also declare its own `fallback_chain`; if omitted, `provider: auto` uses the top-level `fallback_providers` chain (the built-in discovery chain applies only when no main provider is selected).

Context compression is configured under `auxiliary.compression`:

```yaml
auxiliary:
  compression:
    provider: main                                    # Same provider options as other auxiliary tasks
    model: google/gemini-3-flash-preview
    base_url: null                                    # Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint
```

And the primary fallback chain uses:

```yaml
fallback_providers:
  - provider: openrouter
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
    # base_url: http://localhost:8000/v1             # Optional custom endpoint
```

All three — auxiliary, compression, fallback — work the same way: set `provider` to pick who handles the request, `model` to pick which model, and `base_url` to point at a custom endpoint (overrides provider).

### Provider Options for Auxiliary Tasks

These options apply to `auxiliary:`, `compression:`, and `fallback_providers:` entries only — `"main"` is **not** a valid value for your top-level `model.provider`. For custom endpoints, use `provider: custom` in your `model:` section (see [AI Providers](../../integrations/providers.md)).

| Provider | Description | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `"auto"` | Try providers in order until one works (default) | At least one provider configured |
| `"openrouter"` | Force OpenRouter | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| `"nous"` | Force Nous Portal | `hermes auth` |
| `"codex"` | Force Codex OAuth | `hermes model` → ChatGPT or Codex Subscription |
| `"main"` | Use whatever provider the main agent uses (auxiliary tasks only) | Active main provider configured |
| `"anthropic"` | Force Anthropic native | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or Claude Code credentials |

### Direct Endpoint Override

For any auxiliary task, setting `base_url` bypasses provider resolution entirely and sends requests directly to that endpoint:

```yaml
auxiliary:
  vision:
    base_url: "http://localhost:1234/v1"
    api_key: "local-key"
    model: "qwen2.5-vl"
```

`base_url` takes precedence over `provider`. Hermes uses the configured `api_key` for authentication, falling back to `OPENAI_API_KEY` if not set. It does **not** reuse `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for custom endpoints.

---

## Auxiliary Capacity-Error Fallback

When you set an explicit auxiliary provider (e.g. `auxiliary.vision.provider: glm`), Hermes treats that as your preferred choice — but if the provider literally cannot serve the request because of a **capacity error** (HTTP 402 payment required, HTTP 429 daily-quota exhaustion, connection failure), Hermes falls back through a layered chain instead of failing silently:

1. **Primary aux provider** — the one you configured (tried first, always)
2. **`auxiliary.<task>.fallback_chain`** — your per-task override list, if you wrote one
3. **Main agent provider + model** — last-resort safety net (always tried, even if you didn't write a chain)
4. **Warn + re-raise** — if every layer fails, Hermes logs `Auxiliary <task>: ... all fallbacks exhausted` at WARNING level and re-raises the original error

Transient HTTP 429 rate limits (`Retry-After: ...`) are treated as request constraints, not capacity problems — they respect your explicit provider choice and do **not** trigger the fallback ladder. Only daily/monthly quota exhaustion, payment errors, and connection failures bypass the explicit-provider gate.

**Auth errors (HTTP 401) on an explicit provider** walk only step 2: if you wrote `auxiliary.<task>.fallback_chain`, its entries are tried in order (and a chain entry that dies mid-request hands off to the next one); the main agent model and the auto-detection chain are never consulted, because you did not opt that task into them. Without a chain the task fails on the auth error as before. Auth is credential-wide, so chain entries on the same provider label are skipped — point the spare at a different provider (a separate `providers:` entry counts).

For users on `provider: auto` (no explicit aux provider), the existing auto-detection chain runs in place of steps 2–3. Its first step is already the main agent model, so `auto` users get the same outcome with zero config.

### Optional: per-task fallback chain

If you want a different fallback ordering than "main agent model first", configure `fallback_chain` explicitly. Each entry needs at least `provider`; `model`, `base_url`, and `api_key` are optional.

```yaml
auxiliary:
  vision:
    provider: glm
    model: glm-4v-flash
    fallback_chain:
      - provider: openrouter
        model: google/gemini-3-flash-preview
      - provider: nous
        model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4

  compression:
    provider: openrouter
    fallback_chain:
      - provider: openai
        model: gpt-4o-mini
        timeout: 240            # optional — this candidate's own deadline (seconds)
```

You do **not** need to configure `fallback_chain` to get fallback — the main-agent safety net runs regardless. Use it only when you specifically want a different order than the default.

Each `fallback_chain` entry may also declare its own `timeout` (seconds). Without it, a fallback candidate inherits the task-level timeout — which may be tuned for the primary provider. Declaring a per-entry `timeout` lets a slower-but-reliable fallback (e.g. a large-context summarizer) get the budget it actually needs instead of dying on the primary's clock.

### Provider quota errors that trigger fallback

Hermes recognizes these as capacity-equivalent to 402 credit exhaustion (not transient rate limits):

- Bedrock / LiteLLM: `Too many tokens per day`, `daily limit`, `tokens per day`
- Vertex AI / GCP: `quota exceeded`, `resource exhausted`, `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`
- Generic: `daily quota`, `quota_exceeded`

If your provider returns a different phrase for daily-quota exhaustion and Hermes doesn't trigger fallback, that's a bug — open an issue with the exact error string.

---

## Context Compression Fallback

Context compression uses the `auxiliary.compression` config block to control which model and provider handles summarization:

```yaml
auxiliary:
  compression:
    provider: "auto"                              # auto | openrouter | nous | main
    model: "google/gemini-3-flash-preview"
```

:::info Legacy migration
Older configs with `compression.summary_model` / `compression.summary_provider` / `compression.summary_base_url` are automatically migrated to `auxiliary.compression.*` on first load (config version 17).
:::

If no provider is available for compression, Hermes drops middle conversation turns without generating a summary rather than failing the session.

---

## Delegation Provider Override

Subagents spawned by `delegate_task` inherit the parent agent's primary fallback chain. You can still route subagents to a different primary provider:model pair for cost optimization:

```yaml
delegation:
  provider: "openrouter"                      # override provider for all subagents
  model: "google/gemini-3-flash-preview"      # override model
  # base_url: "http://localhost:1234/v1"      # or use a direct endpoint
  # api_key: "local-key"
```

See [Subagent Delegation](./delegation.md) for full configuration details.

---

## Cron Job Providers

Unpinned cron jobs inherit your configured `fallback_providers` chain (or legacy `fallback_model`), both when the primary's credentials fail to resolve before the run and when the provider errors mid-run. A job pinned to its own provider, model or endpoint does **not**: if that route fails, the run fails (same-provider [credential pool](../configuration.md#credential-pool-strategies) rotation still applies). This matches how a pinned [delegation](./delegation.md) child behaves. Pin a cron job with `provider` and `model` overrides on the job itself:

```python
cronjob(
    action="create",
    schedule="every 2h",
    prompt="Check server status",
    provider="openrouter",
    model="google/gemini-3-flash-preview"
)
```

To keep fallback for a job, leave it unpinned and choose its model with `cron.model` / `cron.model_provider` instead. See [Scheduled Tasks (Cron)](./cron.md#provider-recovery) for details.

## Summary

| Feature | Fallback Mechanism | Config Location |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Main agent model | `fallback_providers` in config.yaml — per-turn failover on errors (primary restored each turn) | `fallback_providers:` (top-level list) |
| Auxiliary tasks (any) — auto users | Full auto-detection chain (main agent model first, then provider chain) on capacity errors | `auxiliary.<task>.provider: auto` |
| Auxiliary tasks (any) — explicit provider | `fallback_chain` (if set) → main agent model → warn + raise, on capacity errors; auth errors (401) walk `fallback_chain` only | `auxiliary.<task>.fallback_chain` |
| Vision | Layered (see above) + internal OpenRouter retry | `auxiliary.vision` |
| Context compression | Layered (see above); degrades to no-summary if all layers unavailable | `auxiliary.compression` |
| Skills hub | Layered (see above) | `auxiliary.skills_hub` |
| MCP helpers | Layered (see above) | `auxiliary.mcp` |
| Approval classification | Layered (see above) | `auxiliary.approval` |
| Title generation | Layered (see above) | `auxiliary.title_generation` |
| Triage specifier | Layered (see above) | `auxiliary.triage_specifier` |
| Delegation | Uses `delegation.fallback_providers` when declared; otherwise only unpinned children inherit the parent chain | `delegation.provider` / `delegation.model` / `delegation.fallback_providers` |
| Cron jobs | Unpinned jobs inherit the configured `fallback_providers` chain; a job with its own `provider` / `model` / `base_url` never falls back to it | Per-job `provider` / `model`, or `cron.model` / `cron.model_provider` |
