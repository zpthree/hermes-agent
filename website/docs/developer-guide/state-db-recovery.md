# State database and FTS recovery

For the user-facing walkthrough (what to stop, what the files beside `state.db` are, why
maintenance commands refuse while a writer is live) see
[Session storage recovery](../user-guide/session-storage-recovery.md).

`state.db` stores two different data classes:

- `sessions` and `messages` are the canonical transcript.
- `messages_fts*` tables and their sync triggers are derived search indexes.

The derived indexes may be detached temporarily. They must not turn a live
message write or search into an unbounded full-transcript rebuild.

## Live behavior when FTS is corrupt

If an FTS write or search reports the corruption error class, `SessionDB`:

1. records the durable `fts_stale` marker;
2. removes the FTS sync triggers in the same transaction;
3. retries canonical writes without the derived-index sinks; and
4. serves searches from canonical rows through the `LIKE` fallback.

The failing live operation never runs `FTS5('rebuild')`. Existing recovery
ownership remains unchanged: a later `SessionDB` open may rebuild under the
cross-process admission lock and foreign-holder guard. If that guarded rebuild
cannot run, FTS remains detached, canonical writes stay available, and
`hermes doctor` reports the explicit repair command.

## Live behavior when the file itself is corrupt

If a live write reports bare `SQLITE_CORRUPT` / `SQLITE_NOTADB` (`database
disk image is malformed`, `file is not a database`) with no FTS provenance,
the damage is in a canonical B-tree, the schema, or the freelist. `SessionDB`
then quarantines that handle (`StateDbCorruptError`):

1. the failing write propagates the typed error and nothing is retried;
2. later writes on the handle fail immediately without touching the file;
3. the handle never reopens its connection after `close()`; and
4. `close()` skips its explicit WAL checkpoint.

Stopping the writes is the protection. In the field, a handle that kept
writing for ~50 minutes after the first structural error checkpointed 15
pages under the wrong page numbers on shutdown (page 1 received a
`messages_fts_trigram_data` leaf) and turned a damaged-but-readable file into
one that no longer opened at all. Skipping the explicit checkpoint is the
second line of defence; on Python 3.12+ the quarantine also disables
SQLite's own last-connection checkpoint (`SQLITE_DBCONFIG_NO_CKPT_ON_CLOSE`),
so the `-wal` sidecar survives `close()` for forensics. On Python 3.11 that
switch is unavailable and SQLite may still checkpoint once on close, so copy
`state.db`, `state.db-wal` and `state.db-shm` together before restarting
anything.

The gateway and the agent flush path treat the quarantine like a replaced
file: pending transcripts go to `sessions/<id>.jsonl` and the gateway
`pending_messages/` spool instead of the retry queue, and the FTS one-shot
rebuild never runs on the damaged file. The quarantine is per process — the
shared handle stays poisoned for every holder until the process restarts on a
repaired or restored file. Do not run `hermes doctor --fix` while the gateway
is still up. Next steps:

```bash
hermes gateway stop
HERMES_HOME="$HOME/.hermes" hermes sessions recover --source "$HOME/.hermes/state.db" --inspect-only
# if recoverable:
HERMES_HOME="$HOME/.hermes" hermes sessions recover --source "$HOME/.hermes/state.db" --output "$HOME/recovered-state.db"
```

or restore the newest snapshot from `state-snapshots/`.

## Explicit repair

Stop every process that can open the profile database before repairing it.
Keep them stopped for the complete repair and verification window.

```bash
hermes gateway stop
HERMES_HOME="$HOME/.hermes" hermes sessions repair --check-only
HERMES_HOME="$HOME/.hermes" hermes sessions repair
```

`sessions repair` creates a SQLite backup by default and performs structural
work through the repository's guarded snapshot-and-promotion path. Do not copy
`state.db`, `state.db-wal`, and `state.db-shm` independently with `cp`; those
files are one live SQLite image.

After repair, verify the health probe, stale marker, trigger set, and canonical
row counts before restarting the gateway:

```bash
HERMES_HOME="$HOME/.hermes" hermes sessions repair --check-only
sqlite3 "$HOME/.hermes/state.db" \
  "SELECT key, value FROM state_meta WHERE key = 'fts_stale';"
sqlite3 "$HOME/.hermes/state.db" \
  "SELECT type, name FROM sqlite_master WHERE name IN
   ('messages_fts_insert','messages_fts_update','messages_fts_delete')
   ORDER BY name;"
sqlite3 "$HOME/.hermes/state.db" \
  "SELECT 'sessions', COUNT(*) FROM sessions
   UNION ALL SELECT 'messages', COUNT(*) FROM messages;"
```

The marker query should return no row, the expected FTS triggers should be
present, and canonical row counts must not decrease. If repair fails, preserve
both the live database and the reported backup; never delete canonical rows to
make a derived-index error disappear.
