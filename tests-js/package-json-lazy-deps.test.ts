/**
 * Invariants for what is eager vs lazy in the root ``package.json``.
 *
 * The root ``package.json`` is installed by ``hermes update`` on every user,
 * including users who never opted into a given browser backend. Anything
 * listed in ``dependencies`` therefore runs its npm postinstall script for
 * everyone, and — per #43564 — is also part of the npm workspace install
 * graph, where a workspace-scoped ``npm ci`` (``--workspace ui-tui
 * --workspace web``) can silently prune it right back out on the next
 * ``hermes update``.
 *
 * The contract:
 *
 * - ``agent-browser`` is NOT a root dependency. It used to be eager (see
 *   #27055, which reasoned its postinstall was small enough to keep eager
 *   unlike Camofox's) but #43564 found that keeping ANY dependency in root
 *   ``package.json`` — however small its postinstall — entangles it with
 *   the ui-tui/web workspace install and risks it being pruned. It now
 *   resolves at runtime via ``npx agent-browser`` (see
 *   ``tools/browser_tool.py::_find_agent_browser``), which sidesteps the
 *   workspace graph entirely. ``hermes update`` and ``hermes doctor --fix``
 *   both fire-and-forget ``warm_agent_browser_npx_cache()`` to keep npx's
 *   own cache warm, preserving the "available before any session starts"
 *   property #27055 cared about without re-entangling the dependency.
 *
 * - ``@streamdown/math`` is NOT a root dependency either. It's imported only
 *   by desktop's own TS code (``apps/desktop/src/...``), so it belongs in
 *   ``apps/desktop/package.json`` (alongside its sibling ``@streamdown/code``)
 *   — not root, where it was subject to the exact same pruning risk.
 *
 * - ``@askjo/camofox-browser`` is NOT eager. It is an explicit opt-in
 *   alternative browser backend, selected by the user via
 *   ``hermes tools`` → Browser Automation → Camofox, and only used at
 *   runtime when ``CAMOFOX_URL`` is set. Its postinstall fetches a ~300MB
 *   Firefox-fork binary, which silently blocked ``hermes update`` for
 *   multi-minute stretches on slow / network-restricted connections
 *   (notably users in China running through a VPN). The package is
 *   installed on demand by ``tools_config.py`` ``post_setup_key ==
 *   "camofox"`` when the user actually selects Camofox.
 *
 * If a future PR re-adds any of these to root ``dependencies``, this test
 * fails — read the lazy-install guidance in the ``hermes-agent-dev`` skill
 * before changing the expectations.
