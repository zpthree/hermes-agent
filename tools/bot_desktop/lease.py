"""Who may drive a profile's Bot Desktop screen: the agent (default) or exactly one human viewer.

The lease is the single truth shared by the RFB bridge (drops human input from non-holders), the
``computer_use`` tool (refuses to act while a human holds control — the person may be typing a
credential, so even screenshots are refused; fail closed rather than trusting the agent to pause
itself) and the Desktop UI (Watch / Take over / Hand back).

Scope: the lease is a TOOL-LEVEL fence, not a property of the X server. ``computer_use`` and the browser
tools consult it; a process the agent starts by hand against the published ``DISPLAY``/``XAUTHORITY``
(the ``terminal`` tool, a script) is inside the documented same-user boundary and is not stopped by it
(bot-screen.md, "Threat model"; #110040).

Authority lives ON DISK, ``<HERMES_HOME>/bot-desktop/lease.json`` under an fcntl lock, because the
processes that must agree do not share memory: ``hermes serve`` (viewer bridge), the messaging
gateway, a CLI turn and isolated workers all drive the same display. Every read goes to the file;
the in-process Condition only wakes local waiters early. ``epoch`` increments on every transition so
an action admitted under one lease can tell that control changed underneath it.
