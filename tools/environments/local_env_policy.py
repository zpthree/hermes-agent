# runs a Buzz gateway must not get the signing key. Values are used directly, never
# scope-resolved (UnscopedSecretError under multiplex); the snapshot treats them as
# profile-scoped. Prefix-based so future BUZZ_* names need no code change.
# First-party platform credentials the agent's own platform adapters need in terminal children (e.g. the
# ``BUZZ_*`` vars for the Buzz messaging platform, which drive the platform-mandated ``buzz`` CLI:
# BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY, BUZZ_AUTH_TAG, BUZZ_RELAY_URL, and the other BUZZ_* names). These are the agent's OWN
# credentials — a Buzz community agent is expected to operate the ``buzz`` CLI — so they are carved out of
# the terminal scrub. CONTEXT-GATED: the carve-out applies ONLY when this process/session is actually
# operating as a Buzz agent — either the process is a Buzz-ACP managed agent (``BUZZ_MANAGED_AGENT`` is set,
# only by Buzz Desktop's buzz-acp harness; see #76243 / #78511) or the current session's platform is
# ``buzz`` (the gateway's ``HERMES_SESSION_PLATFORM`` ContextVar; concurrency safe under a multi-session
# host). A Telegram/CLI/cron session on a host that also runs a Buzz gateway does NOT get BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY
# in its terminal children — blanket passthrough of a signing key to every terminal child on the host would
# be wrong (maintainer triage note on #76243: don't expose the key to unrelated shell commands).
# ``_sanitize_subprocess_env`` is also consumed by search workers (e.g. the ddgs web-search subprocess), the
# computer-use driver binary, and user-script runners (bang ``!`` commands, quick commands, cron scripts,
# webhook-filter scripts), so those children receive the vars too — matching the approved background/PTY
# scope. Every other surface stays sealed — execute_code scrubbing, :func:`hermes_subprocess_env` (browser /
# TUI host / copilot-executor spawns), docker children, and ``env_passthrough`` registration (skills/config
# still cannot register these names). The GHSA-rhgp-j443-p4rf seal is preserved because no registration path
# is opened; this is a scrub-path exemption, not an allowlist addition. First-party matches use the merged
# env value directly — they are the process's own env values and are never scope-resolved (a profile secret
# scope under multiplex would otherwise raise UnscopedSecretError at passthrough-resolution call sites);
# only skill/config passthrough names resolve through the profile secret scope. The snapshot mechanism
# treats these names like profile-scoped passthrough names (see
# ``LocalEnvironment._additional_profile_scoped_passthrough_names``) so they never persist in the shared
# terminal snapshot across profiles. Contrast with CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN above, which is discarded from
# the blocklist entirely because it is NOT a Hermes credential; these ARE Hermes-managed first-party
# platform credentials, so they stay IN the blocklist for every non-terminal surface. See issue #78026 (Buzz
# agents could not use ``buzz`` from the terminal tool) and #76243 (Buzz Desktop managed agent wakes but
