"""Progressive tool disclosure ("tool search"): MCP/plugin tools and a curated set of
event-triggered core tools are replaced in the model-visible array by three bridge tools —
tool_search / tool_describe / tool_call. Invariants: core tools (``toolsets._HERMES_CORE_TOOLS``)
and session-gated GUI toolsets never defer unless named in ``defer``; ANY deferrable tool
activates the bridge (the listing scales with budget, not activation); the catalog is
stateless — rebuilt from the live tool-defs every assembly (a session-keyed one drifts and
silently drops tools); bridge calls route through ``model_tools.handle_function_call``."""
