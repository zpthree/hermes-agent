"""Shared ``OAuthClientProvider`` customizations for Hermes MCP OAuth.

Two code paths build an SDK provider — ``tools.mcp_oauth.build_oauth_auth`` (legacy public
API) and ``tools.mcp_oauth_manager.MCPOAuthManager`` — and both need the same real-world
fixes and config → constructor-kwargs plumbing. This module holds that core once; the origin
modules keep their own subclass (logger name, disk-watch hooks) on top of it.
