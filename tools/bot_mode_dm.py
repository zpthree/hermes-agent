"""Bot Mode agent-to-agent DM tool — ``message_agent``.

Lets a Bot Mode agent message a teammate (a profile on this install, an agent on
a registered peer gateway, or one on another Desktop-connected machine): the
target is validated against the live roster, the attribution prefix is applied
server-side, and the reply arrives later via the background-process completion
notification (fire-and-forget). Containment: the schema is injected ONLY into a
bot's canonical "Bot Chat" session on a Bot-Mode-managed install (same gate as
``tools/bot_mode_probe.py``; never in the registry or any toolset), and dispatch
re-checks that gate so a forged call returns a structured error. Transports:
local → ``hermes -p <name> chat --in ~ -c "Bot Chat" --create-if-missing -Q
--query-file <tmp>``; peer → ``hermes peer dm <peer>[/<name>] < <tmp>``; both via
``terminal_tool(background=True, notify_on_complete=True)``.
