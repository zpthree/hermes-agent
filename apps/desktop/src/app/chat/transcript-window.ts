/**
 * Bound what reaches assistant-ui at all.
 *
 * Rendering the full transcript of an oversized session rebuilds an unbounded
 * runtime repository on every store update and exhausts the renderer's V8 heap
 * (#55191). The DOM budget in `thread/list.tsx` already bounds what PAINTS, but
 * every message still gets normalized into the repository first — so a session
 * only has to be heavy, not visible, to crash the window.
 *
 * The window spends the same currency as the DOM budget: render weight, not
 * message count. A count cap gets this wrong in both directions — measured on a
 * real 1,175-session store, a 400-message cap would disable itself on 37
 * sessions that are heavy but short (one was 133 messages / 1.05MB) while
 * engaging on 92 long-but-light sessions that were never at risk.
