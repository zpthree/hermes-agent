 * Release the store's paged-through history once it is off the live window.
 *
 * Runs when the window's own cut moves — the only moment the set of rows older
 * than the window changes (streaming grows the tail, "Show earlier" prepends, a
 * re-cut moves the anchor) — so the weight walk never happens per token.
 *
 * The released rows are persisted and stay on the backend, so this is a cache
 * eviction, not data loss: the tail bookkeeping is rewound first (the fetch
 * route must exist before anything is dropped) and the next "Show earlier"
 * fetches them back through the existing older-page backfill.
 *
 * The cut is computed inside the store updater, from the array it is about to
 * replace: a view snapshot can be a flush behind the store, and writing a
 * trimmed version of it back would drop the newest rows of a live turn.
 *
 * `profile` must be referentially stable across renders (the chat view memoizes
 * it): it is a dependency here, and the rewind has to address the same route
 * the render resolved.
