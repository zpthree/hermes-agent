/**
 * Progress check-ins during the first build.
 *
 * Setup hands the first task to a session of its own and then stops. This module counts that session's tool
 * calls and sets `$setupCheckIn` at two of them; the wiring turns each one into a hidden `[setup]` note in the
 * same session, which asks the agent to say where the work stands and what the user wants next. The note
 * arrives in the chat the user is already reading. A cron job would not.
 *
 * Two rules limit the check-ins:
 *
 * - A note is set only between turns, on `message.complete`. A note set mid-turn would become a synthetic
 *   user message inside an assistant turn, which the agent core's role alternation forbids.
 * - No note when the turn already ended with a question. The runbook has the agent ask for a verdict after
 *   the first pass, and a check-in under that ask puts two questions to the user at once.
