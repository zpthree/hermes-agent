/**
 * In-app tips — the app pointing at itself, plus the agent doing the same.
 *
 * Two sources, one bubble, one switch over both of them:
 *
 * - `$tipsEnabled` is the whole feature, ON with a switch to stop it. A feature
 *   nobody meets is a feature nobody has, and the pacing is what earns the
 *   default: minutes into a launch at the earliest, then six hours, which is a
 *   nicety rather than the nag that would owe you an opt-in.
 * - It covers Hermes too. "Off" from someone who has just closed a bubble means
 *   no bubbles, not "no bubbles unless the agent sends one" — so the switch is
 *   mirrored to the gateway, where it takes the `tip` tool out of the model's
 *   schema, and the bridge drops a stray tip on top of that.
 * - `$tipShownAt` is the seen ledger: every tip that reached the screen, with
 *   when. The rotation walks the catalog ONCE against it, so a tip that timed
 *   out is as finished as one the user closed — a second sighting of "type @
 *   to attach a file" is the app forgetting it already said that.
 * - `$retiredTips` is the hard-close ledger. A ✕ says the same thing louder and
 *   is the one record a Reset does not need to respect on its own; Settings →
 *   Reset clears both and starts the lap over.
 * - `$activeTip` is what is on screen. Ephemeral by design: a tip is a nicety,
 *   and one that survives a reload has overstayed.
 *
 * `$lastTipId` is the rotation's cursor and `$nextTipAt` is its clock. Both are
 * persisted, because the alternative is that every relaunch reopens the tour at
 * tip one and re-arms a schedule measured in hours.
