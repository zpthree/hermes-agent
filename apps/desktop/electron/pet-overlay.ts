/**
 * Pure geometry helpers for the popped-out pet overlay — deciding where its
 * window may open and where it must be re-homed when the display topology
 * changes. Side-effect-free so the on-screen validation is unit-testable
 * without booting Electron; main.ts owns the live `screen` displays, the
 * anchor window, and the overlay window itself.
 *
 * The bug this exists for: the renderer remembers the overlay's absolute
 * screen position (localStorage hermes.desktop.pet-overlay-bounds.v1) and
 * reuses it verbatim on the next pop-out / app restart. If that spot was on an
 * external monitor that has since been unplugged, the overlay is created
 * off-screen — and because it is a transparent, frameless, non-activating
 * always-on-top panel hidden from Mission Control, an off-screen overlay is
 * completely unfindable: the pet "vanishes." A window that only *mostly* left
 * the screen is just as lost, so the overlay is kept wholly inside a work area
 * rather than trusting a sliver of overlap (#85092).
