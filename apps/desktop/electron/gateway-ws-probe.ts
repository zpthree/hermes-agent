/**
 * Live WebSocket validation for the remote-gateway "Test remote" button.
 *
 * Background: the desktop boot does two independent things to a remote gateway:
 *
 *   1. The MAIN process hits ``GET /api/status`` over HTTP (token in a header)
 *      to confirm the backend is up. This is what "Test remote" historically
 *      checked, and what the boot logs print as "Remote Hermes backend is
 *      ready".
 *   2. The RENDERER then opens a live WebSocket to ``/api/ws`` (credential in a
 *      query param) via ``gateway.connect()``. The chat surface only works once
 *      THIS succeeds.
 *
 * Those two paths use different processes, transports, and credentials, and the
 * server applies extra guards to the WS upgrade that the HTTP status route never
 * sees (Host/Origin checks, ws-ticket/token auth, peer-IP checks). So a gateway
 * can pass the HTTP status check yet reject the WebSocket — which surfaces to
 * the user as a green "Test remote" followed by an opaque "Could not connect to
 * Hermes gateway" on the boot overlay.
 *
 * This module performs the second half of the check: it actually opens the WS
 * URL and confirms the upgrade is accepted (and isn't immediately torn down by
 * a post-upgrade auth rejection). The ``WebSocketImpl`` is injectable so the
 * unit tests can drive the handshake without a real socket; in production the
 * caller passes the Node/Electron global ``WebSocket``.
 *
 * The boot-time probe of a backend child this app spawned also uses it, with
 * ``keepWaitingWhile``: a Windows cold start can stall the backend's event
 * loop for 12-28s after HTTP is up, well past the fixed 10s budget (#96177).
 * See ``spawnedBackendProbeOptions``.

// the TCP connect but has not answered the upgrade is busy, not refusing (a
