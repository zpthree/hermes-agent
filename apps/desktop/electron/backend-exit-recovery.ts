/**
 * Supervisor decision for a primary backend child's post-ready exit (#112344).
 *
 * The child's `exit` handler classifies the exit as "current" (this child
 * still owned the connection slot) or "stale" (the slot was already cleared
 * or moved on). A stale exit is normally harmless: a replacement owns the
 * slot or a start is already in flight. But the same classification also
 * fires when the slot was emptied and NOTHING followed — the connection was
 * invalidated without a replacement start, or the child's own `error`
 * handler cleared the slot first — and then the UI keeps running with no
 * engine until the user relaunches the app (9 h observed).
 *
 * `claim` answers "does the supervisor own the respawn for this exit?" from
 * the primary slot's state alone. Pool children never enter the decision:
 * they do not own the window backend and must not suppress its recovery.
