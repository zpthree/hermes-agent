// Multiplex-only, Desktop half: ONE `hermes serve` per HOST serves every
// profile, so a local profile never gets a backend process of its own.
//
// `backend-discovery.ts` + `host-backend-attach.ts` made the PRIMARY backend
// attach to a backend the host is already running. This module removes the
// other producer of `hermes serve` children: the per-profile backend pool.
// Every local profile now resolves onto the same host backend and carries its
// own `profile` on the wire — the server binds a SESSION to a profile home
// (`session.create {profile}` -> `profile_home`) and a sessionless RPC to the
// explicit `profile` argument (`tui_gateway/server.py::@_profile_scoped`), so
// one process genuinely serves N homes.
//
// Two things are deliberately NOT collapsed:
//   * `HERMES_DESKTOP_ISOLATED_BACKEND=1` — the escape hatch that gives this
//     app a private backend instead of the host's.
//   * Remote / SSH / Cloud backends — a DIFFERENT host. Its ownership proof
//     (`remote-lifecycle.ts` isolated_count === 1) is about that machine's
//     process, not ours, and stays pooled.
//
// Pure and dependency-injected so the decision tests without Electron.
