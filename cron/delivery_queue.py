"""Profile-local durable handoff for cron delivery through live gateway adapters.

A restart-safe cron worker executes outside the gateway cgroup.  It cannot own
relay/E2EE adapter objects, so it queues the final send here.  A gateway claims
each row at most once.  If that gateway dies after claiming, the outcome is
marked unknown and never retried: losing a delivery is safer than duplicating a
possibly-completed send.
