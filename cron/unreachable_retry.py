"""Automatic bounded re-runs for scheduled fires that never reached the model.

Inspired by Claude Cowork (desktop changelog v1.46388.1, 2026-09-04): "automatic re-runs
(after 5, 15, and 30 minutes) for a scheduled task that could not reach the model at all,
for example right after the computer wakes behind a VPN."

The class is deliberately narrow: the run must have FAILED with a transient network /
DNS error (``cron.scheduler_preflight._is_transient_provider_resolve_error``) AND the
agent must have completed zero API calls. Nothing was executed and nothing was spent, so
re-running cannot double a side effect — unlike a generic failure retry (see PR #16512),
which has to answer for one-shot dispatch accounting and mid-run side effects. Recurring
jobs only: finite one-shots are pre-claimed by ``claim_dispatch`` (at-most-times, #38758)
and must not regain a consumed dispatch here.

While a retry is pending the failure notice is suppressed (Cowork re-runs silently); a
run that reaches the model — success or not — resets the ladder. Disable with
``cron.retry_unreachable: false`` in config.yaml.
