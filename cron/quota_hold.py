"""Hold a job's fires while a provider's usage window is known to be closed (#89376).

A quota-exhausted provider answers with an explicit ``retry after <N>s`` (Codex 429: the
``AuthError`` from ``hermes_cli.auth_codex._codex_quota_exhausted_error``). When the whole
fallback chain is unavailable, re-firing on cadence is guaranteed to fail identically until
the window reopens — every fire is a usage probe plus a delivered failure alert. The failing
run's alert says the job is held; ``mark_job_run`` then parks ``next_run_at`` at the first
scheduled occurrence after the window and stamps ``quota_hold_until`` so the stale-error
re-arm (``cron.jobs._job_is_stale_error_recurring``) does not pull the job back early.

Mirror of ``cron/unreachable_retry.py`` (which pulls ``next_run_at`` EARLIER); this one pushes
it LATER. Any run that reaches the model clears the marker.
