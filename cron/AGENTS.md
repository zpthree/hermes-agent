# cron/ (+ kanban) — scheduled jobs and the multi-agent work queue

Applies on top of the root `AGENTS.md`. Long-form: `website/docs/developer-guide/cron-internals.md`;
user docs `website/docs/user-guide/features/cron.md`, `kanban.md`.

## Cron

`cron/jobs.py` (job store) + `cron/scheduler.py` (tick loop; `scheduler_*.py` siblings). Agents
schedule via the `cronjob` tool; users via `hermes cron list|add|edit|pause|resume|run|remove` or
`/cron`. Schedules: duration (`"30m"`, `"2h"`, `"1d"`), "every" phrase (`"every 2h"`, `"every monday
9am"`), 5-field cron (`"0 9 * * *"`), ISO one-shot (`"2026-06-01T09:00:00Z"`). Per-job fields:
`skills`, `model`/`provider` overrides, `script` (pre-run data-collection script whose stdout is
injected into the prompt; `no_agent=True` makes the script the whole job), `context_from` (chain job
A's last output into job B's prompt), `workdir` (run with that directory's `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`
loaded), multi-platform delivery.

Hardening invariants — each guards a real failure; don't weaken without answering for it:
- **Inactivity watchdog** on cron agent sessions (`_cron_inactivity_seconds()`): default 600s idle,
  `HERMES_CRON_TIMEOUT` overrides, `0` = unlimited. It is idle time, not wall-clock — a stalled
  session is hard-interrupted so it cannot monopolise the scheduler, while a long-but-active job
  is never cut off. Attached scripts (pre-run or `no_agent`) are bounded separately by the script
  timeout (`_DEFAULT_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT`, 3600s).
- Catch-up window = half the period, clamped to 120s–2h; 120s grace for missed one-shots.
- Every recurring occurrence is accounted for: `tick()` advances `next_run_at` BEFORE dispatch
  (at-most-once across a mid-run crash) and stamps `pending_slot` in the same save; a scan that
  finds the stamp with a dead owner restores the instant ONCE (`cron/occurrences.py`), the
  executions ledger's `scheduled_instant` blocks a second fire, `cron.catch_up_missed: false`
  skips past-grace misses with a logged reason. Never drop a slot silently (#107485).
- Per-home tick lock `<home>/cron/.tick.lock` prevents duplicate ticks across processes for
  that profile's store; never a `~/.hermes/...` literal.
- **The ticker binds each served profile's scope for the whole tick, including pre-loop code.**
  `scheduler_provider.py::_start_multiplex` is ONE ticker iterating `profiles_to_serve()`
  sequentially under `_profile_cron_scope(home)` (home + secret scope + terminal scope) — never N
  threads (module globals race). Everything a tick touches lives inside that guard: store open,
  lock path, backoff/failure counters (`_note_tick_failure`), job env construction, and the
  `on_session_end` flush of a finished job. Supervision (`scheduler_thread.py::
  SupervisedTickerThread`; start on gateway boot, stand down for homes another gateway already
  serves, re-enumerate when a profile dir appears or is tombstoned) is per served home, not per
  process. Why: a store opened before the scope was entered wrote a secondary profile's run
  records into the launch profile's `jobs.json`.
- **Cron ownership is not gated on `gateway.multiplex_profiles`.** That flag gates ADAPTERS; one
  host gateway process ticks EVERY profile's store either way (`run.py::_cron_tick_profile_homes`).
  Gating the tick set on it left every non-launch profile's jobs in a store no ticker visited.
- **Per-profile process assumptions are the bug class.** One process ticks N homes, so anything
  keyed on "this process's profile" is wrong: in-flight state (`_running_job_ids`,
  `_running_since`, `_running_futures`, `_running_worker_pids`, `_running_fire_owners`,
  `_interrupted_job_ids`) is keyed by `_inflight_key(job_id)` = `(home key, job id)` — two
  profiles legitimately carry a `daily-brief`; the parallel pool is keyed by home
  (`cron.max_parallel_jobs` is per profile); and the stale-code yield gate asks
  `scheduler_ownership.owns_cron_tick_for(home)` / `live_gateway_ticking(home)` instead of the
  process-global runtime-lock boolean. Public accessors (`get_running_job_ids`,
  `get_running_job_details`, `get_wedged_job_ids`) still report the host-wide union of bare job
  ids for the shutdown drain, but LIVENESS consumers (`jobs.py::_job_running_in_this_process`,
  `tools/cronjob_tools`) ask `is_job_running(job_id, home=...)` — the union made profile A's
  running `daily-brief` answer for profile B's idle one.
- **A claim is released under the key it was registered with.** The cron scope is a ContextVar:
  `try_register_running_job` runs on the ticker thread inside `_profile_cron_scope`, while the
  pool worker's `finally` sits OUTSIDE `ctx.run` and resolves the LAUNCH home. Pass the
  registering home (`release_running_job(job_id, home=...)`), or every secondary profile's claim
  leaks — the job skips a fire window until the force-release backstop sweeps it, and the drain
  sees phantom work. Never rebuild a home from a key half (`Path(key[0])`): `hermes_home_key`
  normcases, so use `_inflight_home_path`.
- **Ticked-home state is reclaimed when a home leaves the set.** `register_ticked_homes` is
  republished every cycle and reaps the departed homes' parallel pools; pools used to live until
  `atexit`, so each home ever ticked kept a ThreadPoolExecutor and its worker threads forever.
- **The host gateway stands down for a profile that runs its OWN gateway.** `run.py::
  _cron_profile_gate` (the same gate `hermes_cli/web_server.py` passes) keeps the launch process
  and a per-profile gateway off one store: the tick lock stops a simultaneous double-run but not
  the race, and when the launch process wins, delivery goes through `SharedRouteAdapters`/
  fail-closed instead of that profile's live adapters. The gate compares the liveness PID against
  `os.getpid()` — this process holds the launch `gateway.pid` AND publishes every served profile
  in `served_profiles`, so a bare liveness answer would stand cron down host-wide.
- Cron sessions pass `skip_memory=True`; memory providers intentionally do not run during cron.
- Cron execution has its own session. Eligible continuable deliveries may mirror or seed the
  reply-facing conversation: origin, origin-less home fallback, user-written bare-platform home,
  or opted-in explicit targets. `all` expansions do not gain home mirror eligibility. Mirrored
  briefs are labelled user turns appended at a turn boundary, preserving role alternation.
- The cron ticker runs in the desktop-spawned backend when `HERMES_DESKTOP=1` — that env var means
  "spawned by the app", not "a GUI is watching" (root: capability is a property of the session).
- Background `delegate_task` is process-local; work that must survive restarts is a cron job or a
  `terminal(background=True, notify_on_complete=True)` process.

## Kanban (multi-agent work queue)

Durable SQLite-backed board letting multiple profiles/workers collaborate. Users: `hermes kanban
<verb>`; dispatcher-spawned workers use a dedicated `kanban_*` toolset so their schema footprint is
zero outside a kanban task (footprint ladder rung 3).

- **CLI:** `hermes_cli/kanban.py` facade + 14 `kanban_*.py` siblings (`boards`, `db`, `db_connect`,
  `db_dispatch`, `db_notify`, `db_graph` (task initialization and decomposition), `workspace`, ...). Verbs: `init, create, list (ls), show, assign, link,
  unlink, comment, attach, attachments, attach-rm, complete, request-review, request-changes,
  reopen-review, block, unblock, archive, tail`, plus `watch, stats, runs, log, assignees, heartbeat,
  notify-*, dispatch, daemon, gc`. Argparse alias dispatch must accept both `list` and `ls` (root).
- **Toolset:** `tools/kanban_tools.py` — `kanban_show, kanban_complete, kanban_request_review,
  kanban_request_changes, kanban_block, kanban_heartbeat, kanban_comment, kanban_create, kanban_link,
  kanban_attach, kanban_attach_url, kanban_attachments`; platforms whose saved selection enables
  `kanban` (`hermes tools enable kanban --platform <p>`; default-off, in `CONFIGURABLE_TOOLSETS`) get
  the full set plus `kanban_list`/`kanban_unblock` for board routing. The check_fn reads the schema
  build's own selection (`tools/kanban_toolset_context.py`), never the legacy top-level `toolsets`
  key alone.
- **Dispatcher:** long-lived loop (default 60s) that reclaims stale claims, promotes ready tasks,
  atomically claims, and spawns assigned profiles. Runs **inside the gateway** by default
  (`kanban.dispatch_in_gateway: true`). Standalone: `plugins/kanban/systemd/hermes-kanban-dispatcher.service`.
- **Plugin assets:** `plugins/kanban/dashboard/` (web UI) + systemd unit. `kanban_db.connect` is its
  own connection helper — do not alias it to `projects_db.connect` (a path-proximity generator did).

Isolation: **board** is the hard boundary — workers get `HERMES_KANBAN_BOARD` pinned in their env and
cannot see other boards; **tenant** is a soft namespace within a board (workspace-path + memory-key
isolation, one fleet serving several businesses). After `kanban.failure_limit` consecutive
non-success attempts on a task (default 2) the dispatcher auto-blocks it to stop spin loops; a
worker exit of `KANBAN_TERMINAL_PROVIDER_EXIT_CODE` (78 — credential revoked, model gone; the
worker's own `failure_reason` classification via `cli._TERMINAL_PROVIDER_REASONS`) trips it on
the first attempt, sticky, because no retry can heal it (#114587).
Process-identity note: `kanban --preserve-cache` contains "serve" — never classify processes by argv
substring (root). Worker liveness is `(worker_pid, worker_started_at)` — the start-time fingerprint
(`gateway.status.get_process_start_time`) recorded at claim time — never bare PID existence, or a
recycled PID gets killed on reclaim.

- **Notifications leave through the task's owning profile.** `hermes_cli/kanban_db_notify.py`
  subscriptions carry the profile; `gateway/kanban_watchers_notifier.py` delivers via THAT
  profile's adapter under its scope (`_notify_profile_filter`), never the multiplexer's launch
  adapter; a fail-closed skip logs once at WARNING with the remedy, never a bare `continue`.
  Dispatched workers get `HERMES_KANBAN_BOARD` and the assignee's `HERMES_HOME` pinned in a
  scrubbed child env (`build_subprocess_env` + `strip_launch_profile_env`); they never inherit the
  default profile's `.env`.
- **Prompt injection sites gate on ownership, not tool access.** Tool access (`kanban_show` visible
  via a profile's toolset) and an inherited `HERMES_KANBAN_TASK` (delegate children, cron runs beside
  a worker) are not ownership. The kanban guidance (`agent_init`, `system_prompt` fallback) and the
  stop nudge resolve the task via `agent/delegation_context.py::owned_kanban_task()`; other readers
  pair their env read with `is_dispatcher_owned_worker_context()`.
- **Descendant fence is a path, not a flag.** A delegated child's Kanban marker
  (`agent/delegation_context.py::DELEGATED_CHILD_ENV_MARKER`) carries the fenced board ROOT;
  `kanban_path_is_fenced(path)` denies mutations only on the dispatcher-pinned `HERMES_KANBAN_DB`
  or under that root, so a child working against a scratch `HERMES_HOME` keeps a writable board.

## Tests

`tests/cron/`, `tests/hermes_cli/test_kanban*.py`, `tests/tools/test_kanban*.py`. Schedule parsing
and catch-up windows are pure functions — test them as data. Never assert on the verb list or
toolset size (root: no change-detectors). Time-based tests use loose bounds (≥ 2s) and event sync.
