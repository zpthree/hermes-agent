# get_default_hermes_root() — the shared root would funnel every profile's jobs into one jobs.json
# and run them under the ticker's HERMES_HOME, leaking config/credentials/skills across profiles.
# Each profile owns its own cron store under its own HERMES_HOME, and a profile-scoped gateway runs that
# profile's jobs under that same HERMES_HOME — so a job authored in profile `coder` lives in
# `~/.hermes/profiles/coder/cron/jobs.json` and executes with `coder`'s `.env`, `config.yaml`, and skills.
# Do NOT change this to the default root: that re-breaks per-profile isolation. See also the dynamic
