"""Pre-suffix Windows gateway launchers: the objects the current per-profile names cannot reach.

Before task/launcher names carried ``_profile_suffix()``, an install wrote the Scheduled Task
``Hermes_Gateway``, the Startup entry ``Hermes_Gateway.vbs``/``.cmd`` and the launcher pair
``gateway-service\\Hermes_Gateway.{vbs,cmd}``. Every operation in ``gateway_windows`` is keyed on
``get_task_name()`` → ``Hermes_Gateway_<suffix>``, so those strays are never queried, rewritten,
reported or removed: they keep launching a second gateway at logon, never pick up launcher
fixes, and ``hermes gateway status`` prints ✓ while they do (#116157). This module enumerates
them once; ``status`` warns, ``uninstall`` and ``install --force`` remove.
