# Older installs only have gateway_state; newer lifecycle commands persist desired_state separately
# so a transient runtime state can't erase operator intent.
# Transient sub-states of a RUNNING gateway (not an operator stop, not a failed boot). A gateway
# hard-killed in one of them with no `desired_state` would otherwise stay DOWN on every later boot
# (observed: staging stranded at `draining`); map them to `running`, mirroring gateway/run.py.
# `starting` / `startup_failed` are excluded: auto-restarting a mid-boot death is the crash-loop.
# A gateway only ever reaches these while it is up and serving, so they are NOT an operator stop and NOT a
# failed boot: - `draining`  — written by the drain watcher / scale-to-zero go-dormant path when an
# in-flight quiesce begins (gateway/run.py). - `degraded`  — written when the gateway comes up with some
# platforms queued for retry, then "falls through to the normal running state" (gateway/run.py #5196): the
# process is up, serving cron + whatever platforms connected, and the reconnect watcher takes the rest from
# there. When a gateway is hard-killed *while in one of these states* (a container/VM recreate SIGTERMs it
# before `_stop_impl` reaches its terminal-state persist), the last value left in gateway_state.json is the
# transient sub-state. With no explicit `desired_state` to fall back to, treating that literal value as the
# autostart intent would leave the gateway DOWN on every subsequent boot — the gateway never comes back, the
# dashboard is up but messaging stays dark (observed on a relay-opted-in staging instance stranded at
# `draining`, 2026-06; `degraded` is the same wedge class). Map these transient sub-states to `running` so a
# stranded marker reads as the run-intent it actually represents. This mirrors gateway/run.py's #42675
# handling, which persists `running` (not the mid-shutdown `draining`) when an unexpected signal tears the
# gateway down — extended here to the case where the gateway died before it could persist anything at all.
