    """Run a short ``git`` probe and return stripped stdout, or ``""`` on ANY failure.

    On Windows ``run()``'s post-timeout cleanup calls an unbounded ``communicate()``; a suspended
    descendant git.exe holding the pipe handles then blocks forever. Here: bounded ``communicate``,
    tree-kill plus a 1s drain, then abandon the pipes; on POSIX the probe gets its own process
    group so cleanup also takes down credential/remote helpers.

    Security (GHSA-7x36-8jrh-v4pw): these probes run automatically against whatever directory the
    session sits in, before any tool call or trust prompt, and an index refresh executes the
    repo-configured ``core.fsmonitor`` program. Every probe therefore runs under
    :func:`noninteractive_git_env`; diff-rendering callers additionally pass
    :data:`NO_DRIVER_DIFF_FLAGS` (attribute-scoped drivers can't be disabled via env).

    Killing the PATH-resolved launcher can leave a suspended descendant ``git.exe`` holding duplicates of
    the captured stdout/stderr handles, so the pipes never reach EOF and the reader-thread join blocks
    forever. On the Desktop agent-build path (``_start_agent_build → _session_info → branch() → run_git``)
    that turned an optional branch label into ``agent initialization timed out`` (issues #68609 / #66037).
    The normal-path spawn contract mirrors the previous ``run`` call byte-for-byte: PIPE/PIPE/DEVNULL,
    ``text`` with UTF-8 ``errors="replace"`` decoding, and the hidden-window ``creationflags`` on Windows
    only. On POSIX the probe is additionally placed in its own process group (``process_group=0``, Python
    ≥3.11) so timeout cleanup can take down descendants — credential helpers, ``git-remote-https``, hook
    children — with the launcher instead of orphaning them (see :func:`kill_process_tree`; port of
    openai/codex#36793). ``process_group`` only changes which group the child belongs to; it does not detach
    the terminal or alter the fast path.
