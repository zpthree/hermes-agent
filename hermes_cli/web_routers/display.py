"""``/api/display/ws`` — raw RFB over WebSocket for the Bot Desktop viewer.

The Desktop renderer calls ``display.observe`` on its authenticated ``/api/ws`` connection, gets a
single-use 30 s ticket pinned to that profile's RFB socket, then opens this route with
``?display_ticket=``. No websockify, no new port: the bridge splices the profile's 0600 Unix socket
into the WebSocket as binary frames with backpressure both ways, and runs the client stream through
:class:`tools.bot_desktop.rfb_filter.RfbClientFilter` so keyboard, pointer and clipboard reach Xvnc
only from the viewer that currently holds the lease. noVNC's ``viewOnly`` is UX; this is the gate.

A lease change closes the evicted viewer's socket with 4000 ``control-taken`` so its UI drops back to
Watch mode and reconnects.

Design notes. The ticket rides in the query string on purpose: noVNC's Websock owns the socket and
cannot negotiate a subprotocol or add a header, and the ticket is single-use and expires in 30 s, so
a logged URL is spent by the time anyone reads it. The bridge's input gate re-reads ``lease.json`` at
most every ``_LEASE_REFRESH_S`` (250 ms) between in-process ``on_change`` callbacks: that bounds how
long another PROCESS's takeover can go unnoticed, and is the price of not stat-ing the lease file on
the event loop for every pointer move.
