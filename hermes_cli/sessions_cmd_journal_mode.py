"""`hermes sessions set-journal-mode delete|wal` — the offline self-service path for #100896.

``database.journal_mode: delete`` can never self-apply on a store that is already WAL:
``apply_wal_with_fallback`` deliberately never live-downgrades (#68545 — other gateway/cron/worker connections
may hold uncheckpointed WAL commits). Before this command the only escape hatch was an undocumented hand-run
``PRAGMA journal_mode=DELETE``. This runs it under the same admission the maintenance paths use: refuse while
ANY foreign process holds the file or a sidecar (``foreign_state_db_holders``), flip without waiting out openers
(``_set_journal_mode_no_wait``), then verify the header bytes 18/19 SQLite writes for the mode.
