"""The effective USER config: config.yaml + managed overlay + ``${VAR}`` expansion, no defaults.

``load_config()`` merges ``DEFAULT_CONFIG`` first, which is wrong for readers that treat a
missing key as "unset" (the gateway's presence-sensitive env bridge, ``cfg == {}`` sentinels,
cron model pinning) — so nine surfaces used to hand-roll raw-read → overlay → expand in
differing orders and none of them replayed the model-key canonicalization or the last-known-good
recovery ``load_config()`` gained. This module is that one primitive.

Order matches ``_load_config_impl``: the user layer is expanded BEFORE the managed overlay so a
managed ``${VAR}`` resolves against the process environment only (``apply_managed_overlay``
expands it) and can never be re-resolved through a profile's secret scope
(docs/design/managed-scope.md §4.1). ``read_user_config_raw`` stays the write-back primitive.
