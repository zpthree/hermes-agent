"""Post-swap hand-off: finish ``hermes update`` in an interpreter born on the pulled code.

``hermes update`` starts in an interpreter that imported the PRE-pull tree. Once ``git merge``
(or the ZIP swap) has replaced the checkout, every later phase — dependency sync, Node/web/
Desktop builds, maintenance, fleet restart, verification, receipt — used to keep running in
that stale process and lazily import NEW source into an OLD ``sys.modules`` graph. Any rename
between the two commits then surfaced as an ``ImportError``/``AttributeError`` inside the
updater itself, after the code swap had already succeeded (#87134, #112465, #112558, #112604
and their siblings). Module purges and targeted reloads only ever moved the crash to the next
unpurged module.

The permanent shape: the pre-pull process stops at the swap, writes everything the tail needs
into a hand-off file and re-executes ``hermes update --post-swap <file>`` under the venv
interpreter. The child imports exclusively from the pulled tree, resumes the open receipt and
owns the rest of the run; the parent relays its exit code. Nothing in the updater runs pulled
code inside a pre-pull interpreter any more, so there is no stale-symbol class left to isolate.
