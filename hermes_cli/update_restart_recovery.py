"""Restart supervised gateway profiles from a clean Python generation.

The normal update command keeps executing in the interpreter that started before
``git pull``.  This module is deliberately small: it imports no gateway code
itself and launches the regular per-profile gateway command in a new
interpreter.  It is used only after the in-process restart phase has raised, so
that the recovery path cannot inherit the stale ``sys.modules`` graph that
caused the failure.

Outcome vocabulary (deliberately conservative):

- ``verified``          — the relaunch command exited 0 AND the profile's
  systemd unit was independently observed ``active`` afterwards.  This is the
  only outcome that may claim supervisor coverage.
- ``relaunch_attempted`` — the relaunch command exited 0 but no independent
  supervisor observation was possible (non-systemd supervisor, ``systemctl``
  missing, or the unit probe was inconclusive).  ``rc == 0`` from
  ``gateway restart`` is not proof that the new code generation is running,
  so this outcome must never be treated as verified coverage.
- ``failed``            — the relaunch command errored, timed out, or exited
  non-zero.

The pass covers two runtime families, because the in-process restart phase
covers both and an abort can strand either one (#92145):

- **gateway profiles**, relaunched through the existing per-profile
  ``hermes_cli.main -p <profile> gateway restart`` command; and
- **``hermes-serve*`` systemd units**, restarted directly through
  ``systemctl``.  ``hermes serve`` is not a gateway profile and has no
  per-profile relaunch command, but it is the runtime that hosts
  ``tui_gateway.server``: the process the original report saw answering every
  chat turn with an ``ImportError`` for a symbol that existed on disk.  The
  unit family is enumerated from systemd itself rather than from the update
  inventory, so a manually launched or Desktop-owned ``hermes serve`` — which
  has no relaunch authority — can never enter this path.

Serve-unit identity is always ``<scope>/<unit>`` (``user/hermes-serve``,
``system/hermes-serve``).  The two managers can each own a unit of the same
name and they are different processes: an identity that projects the scope
away lets one settled unit suppress recovery of the other, and lets one
scope's outcome speak for the other's.  Scope is therefore never dropped and
reconstructed — not in the skip payload, not in ``verified``/``failed``, not
in the receipt.
