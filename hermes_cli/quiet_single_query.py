"""Quiet ``hermes chat -Q`` helpers: bind this session's key and resume nested notifies.

Bot Mode delivers a local DM as ``hermes -p <bot> chat -Q --query-file``. Interactive
chat binds ``set_current_session_key(self.session_id)`` around the turn; the quiet
path did not, so a nested ``message_agent`` notify inherited the dispatcher's
``HERMES_SESSION_KEY`` and never woke the recipient. Quiet also printed and exited
after one turn, so a nested teammate reply that finished during the one-shot linger
was never injected as a follow-up.

    ``terminal.oneshot_completion_wait_seconds``, whose default equals the delivery caps, so
    waiting for process exit booked every delivered turn that left a reply pending as a timeout
    and killed the linger (#113608, #114980). A child that exits is booked from its real exit

    multi-byte write) must not raise in the drain thread and take the reply and the failure tail
    with it (#105582). Without an explicit *encoding* they decode as UTF-8 only on win32, where
    the child is guaranteed UTF-8 (hermes_bootstrap reconfigures its streams even under
    PYTHONIOENCODING=cp1252) while the gateway parent is not started in UTF-8 mode, so the
    locale default mangled or lost accented replies (#115894); on POSIX the child keeps the
