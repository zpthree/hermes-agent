# Hermes Plugin Catalog

Curated, Nous-approved Hermes plugins. Each YAML file in this directory
(except `removed.yaml`) is one catalog entry, discoverable via
`hermes plugins catalog` / `hermes plugins search` and installable with
`hermes plugins install <name>`.

## Admission policy

Presence in this directory **is** the trust signal. The rules that keep it
meaningful:

1. **Human-merged gate.** Entries are added *only* via a PR to the
   `hermes-agent` repository, reviewed and merged by a maintainer. There is
   no self-serve registry, no automated ingestion.
2. **Exact SHA pins are mandatory.** Every entry pins a full 40-character
   commit SHA. Branches, tags, and short SHAs are rejected by the loader.
   Installs clone the repository and check out exactly that commit.
3. **No self-updating code.** A listed plugin must not fetch and replace
   its own files (in-app "check for updates", signed release downloaders,
   remote `plugin.js` loaders). The exact SHA pin *is* the trust model; a
   self-updater lets an installed copy move to a commit nobody reviewed.
   Updates reach users only through a SHA-bump PR here plus
   `hermes plugins update <name>`. Keep the updater in the standalone
   distribution if you want one; strip it from the catalog build.
4. **SHA bumps are new PRs.** Updating an entry's pin is a new PR whose diff
   (old SHA → new SHA) is re-reviewed like any other change — reviewers are
   expected to look at the upstream commit range being adopted.
5. **Owner-or-major-contributor submissions, or a maintainer-curated sweep.**
   An entry may be submitted by the plugin repository's owner or a major
   contributor to it; drive-by submissions of third-party repos are declined.
   Hermes maintainers may also add entries in batches from a reviewed sweep
   of community plugins (every pin validated and scanned at the pinned
   commit, self-updater and credential-store checks run, English-first UI).
   Authors of swept-in entries keep control: a PR from the owner adjusting
   or removing their entry is accepted on request, and SHA bumps stay
   owner-or-maintainer PRs under rule 4.
6. **Declared capabilities must match reality.** The `capabilities:` block
   (tools, hooks, middleware, env vars) must match what the plugin actually
   registers at the pinned commit. Validation fails the entry otherwise —
   undeclared capability creep is treated as a security issue.
7. **The install scanner runs at admission.** `hermes plugins validate` includes
   the `security scan` check: `dangerous` fails the entry; `caution` findings
   appear as warnings in the CI log and the reviewer reads them before merging.
   In exchange, installs at the pinned SHA accept `caution` without a prompt
   (`dangerous` still blocks). Review the warnings; do not merge past them.
8. **Desktop plugins stay inside the SDK surface.** A `desktop/plugin.js` runs
   in the Desktop renderer with the app's full authority (the loader isolates
   errors, not capabilities), so a listed one may only use the plugin SDK:
   no prototype patching (`X.prototype.y =`, `Object.defineProperty(...prototype`),
   no `eval`/`new Function`, no `import()` of anything but `@hermes/plugin-sdk`
   / `react` (app bundle chunks, blob or http URLs included), no script-tag
   injection, no reaching into the app's internal stores. `hermes plugins
   validate` refuses these at admission (`desktop surface` check); a plugin
   that needs a capability the SDK lacks asks for an SDK hook instead of
   patching around it.
9. **Dependency security policy is the plugin's.** Hermes's 14-day
   `exclude-newer` quarantine covers Hermes's own dependencies only; a plugin's
   `python_dependencies` / `pyproject.toml` install under the plugin's policy
   (no quarantine, still inside Hermes's core constraints). Reviewers read the
   dependency list at the pinned SHA: bare floors (`>=X` with no upper bound)
   and floors on the newest release get a request for the oldest
   API-compatible floor plus an upper bound, and authors are strongly
   recommended to run their own release quarantine (`uv --exclude-newer` in
   their CI) — see the developer guide's *Dependency security policy*. A
   recent floor alone is not grounds to hold an entry.

## Entry schema

```yaml
name: example-plugin        # [a-z0-9_-]{1,64}, the catalog key
repo: https://github.com/owner/repo   # https:// only
sha: <40-hex commit sha>    # mandatory exact pin
subdir: ""                  # optional path within the repo
description: One-line description.
maintainer: OwnerName
tier: official              # official | community (default community)
category: memory            # desktop | memory | platform | web | tools | voice | automation | models | general
                            # (default desktop) — the shelf the entry sits on at /docs/plugins
requires_hermes: ">=0.19"   # optional
docs_url: ""                # optional
version: "1.4.0"            # optional human label for the sha (quote it); shown as "1.4.0 @ abcd1234"
image: ""                   # optional https image on a GitHub host, 2:1 (e.g. 1200x600), e.g.
                            # https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owner/repo/<sha>/docs/banner.png
screenshots: []             # optional, up to 6 https images on a GitHub host; gallery on /docs/plugins/<name>
readme: true                # optional, default true; the README at the PINNED SHA renders on /docs/plugins/<name>
platforms: []               # optional, e.g. [linux, macos]; empty = all
capabilities:
  provides_tools: []
  provides_hooks: []
  provides_middleware: []
  requires_env: []
```

`version`, `image`, `screenshots` and `readme` are cosmetic: none is parsed or
used to pick what installs. The sha stays the release; bump `version` in the
same PR that bumps `sha` so the label on the card matches the code. Images must
live on `raw.githubusercontent.com`, `github.com` or `*.githubusercontent.com`
so the Desktop catalog and the docs site never fetch from third-party hosts;
pin the raw URL to the entry's commit and the picture is as immutable as the
code.

Every entry gets a page at `https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/plugins/<name>`
and every maintainer a page at `/docs/plugins/by/<maintainer>`, both generated
from these files at docs build time. `screenshots:` fills the page's gallery;
the build fetches the README (from `subdir` if set, else the repo root) **at the
pinned sha** — GitHub and GitLab repos, on by default, `readme: false` opts out — and renders it
through an allowlist (raw HTML dropped, links and images resolved against the
pinned tree). The page therefore shows the README the reviewer read, and it
changes only when a reviewed re-pin lands.

## removed.yaml — the blocklist

When an entry is pulled from the catalog for security or policy reasons, it
is recorded in `removed.yaml` with a reason and date. The installer refuses
to install anything matching a removed entry's name or repo URL, so a
malicious plugin cannot be re-installed from a stale identifier after
removal. Removals, like additions, land via reviewed PRs.

Delisting is different from removal: an entry that is merely unmaintained, superseded, or
squatting a name it is not affiliated with is deleted from the catalog (plain file removal,
users who already installed it are unaffected) and is welcome back under a distinct name.

## Names

The catalog key and the manifest `name:` are what users search, install, and — for memory
providers — put in `memory.provider`. A `memory` / `exclusive` entry must not reuse the name of
another provider or of a well-known upstream project it is not affiliated with: two providers
registering the same `register_memory_provider` name make `memory.provider` ambiguous
(whichever loads last wins). Reviewers check the registered provider name, not just the file
name, and the affiliated project gets the bare key.
