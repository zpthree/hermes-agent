"""Memos for ``profiles.list``'s per-profile fields, each keyed on the file(s) it derives from.

The Bots roster polls ``profiles.list`` every 5s PER CONNECTION, and two groups of fields on every
row are recomputed from disk each time even though nothing has changed:

- the **session fields** (``last_session`` / ``worker_session`` / ``canonical_session``) — a
  read-only ``state.db`` open plus a listing query plus the canonical-title lookup, per profile;
- the **ui_meta fields** (``ui_meta`` / ``ui_meta_revisions``) — a second parse of that profile's
  ``profile.yaml``, which the listing body already parsed once for description/display_name.

Both are pure functions of the files they read, so while those files have not moved there is
nothing to recompute: an idle fleet re-derived identical rows every five seconds for every bot.

Signatures carry each file's ``(mtime_ns, size)`` so a write landing inside one mtime tick still
invalidates; ``profile.yaml`` also carries its inode, because the atomic writers rename a temp file
into place. A profile missing the file a memo keys on is never cached — reading it costs nothing,
and one written later must be picked up.

Only DERIVED values live here. The raw readers keep their uncached contract: ``_read_profile_yaml``
is also used by the ui_meta CAS writer, which reads that document, mutates it and writes it back, and
a stale read there would overwrite a newer file.

This is a module of its own because ``methods_profiles``'s bodies are rebound onto ``server.py``'s
globals (``method_ctx.bind_module``), which COPIES module-level dicts rather than sharing them — a
cache declared there would be written to one copy and read from another.
