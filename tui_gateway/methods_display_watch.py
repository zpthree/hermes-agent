"""Cross-process lease watcher: ``display.lease`` for transitions made OUTSIDE ``hermes serve``.

The lease (``tools.bot_desktop.lease``) lives on disk and is changed by whatever process hosts the
agent — a ``hermes computer-use screen`` takeover from the CLI, a cron worker's release.
``lease.on_change`` only fires in the writing process, so ``methods_display``'s in-process
listener never sees those; the Desktop's hero tone and pane state stayed stale until the
pane was reopened. One daemon thread stats every served home's ``bot-desktop/lease.json`` (launch
home + ``_served_profile_homes``) every 0.5s and broadcasts the SAME ``display.lease`` payload when
the epoch moves. Bodies are rebound onto server.py's globals (method_ctx.bind_module).
