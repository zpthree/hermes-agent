"""Bot Desktop JSON-RPC handlers: the Desktop app's door to a profile's headless screen.

``display.status`` reports runtime + lease; ``display.start`` / ``display.stop`` manage the Xvnc/Xfce
process; ``display.observe`` mints a single-use ticket the renderer redeems on ``/api/display/ws``
(``hermes_cli.web_routers.display``) to stream raw RFB; ``display.lease.acquire`` / ``release`` are
Take over / Hand back. ``display.install`` runs the distro package install on the gateway host: sudo
privilege is asked for through the masked ``display.install.sudo`` server→client request (same ``_ask``
bridge as the terminal tool's sudo prompt), stdout streams as ``display.install.log`` and the run ends with
``display.install.done`` carrying a fresh status snapshot. Every handler is profile-scoped so a multiplexed gateway answers for the bot
the pane is looking at. Lease transitions fan out as the global ``display.lease`` event so every
connected client repaints (badge on the bot row, red border on the viewer, agent handoff prompt).

Bodies are rebound onto server.py's globals (method_ctx.bind_module) and reference them bare.
