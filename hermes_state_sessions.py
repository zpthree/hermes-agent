        and this row's own ``cwd``/``git_repo_root``/ ``git_branch``/``profile_name`` are still NULL after
        the insert, they are backfilled from the parent row. Callers of ``create_session`` for a child
        session historically didn't propagate these fields themselves (e.g. the compression-fork path), so a
        lineage could silently lose its working directory and drop out of the project sidebar every time it
        forked (#64709), or lose its owning profile and be aggregated as "default" every time it rotated or
        branched (the cross-profile session-jump bug). This only fills NULLs — an explicit value on the

        (``user_id``/``session_key``/``chat_id``/``chat_type``/
        ``thread_id``/``display_name``/``origin_json``) are inherited too, so a crash before the gateway
        re-records the peer can't strand the child without a recoverable routing mapping (#59527).
        When the caller passes no ``profile_name`` at all, the row is stamped with THIS store's own profile
        (:meth:`_own_profile_name`) instead of NULL. Every ``state.db`` belongs to exactly one profile — the
        same single-match contract :meth:`backfill_null_session_profiles` relies on — so the stamp is
        derivation, not a guess. Rows minted NULL after that one-shot #94724 backfill ran stayed NULL
        forever, and profile-keyed consumers (desktop sidebar scope matching, ``@session:<profile>/<id>``
        deep links, the fail-closed owner ladder) treat NULL as unowned: the session vanishes from the
        sidebar even though its transcript is intact (#99222). Stores outside the profile tree (explicit
        ``db_path`` in tests, ad-hoc copies) derive nothing and keep NULL — never guess.
