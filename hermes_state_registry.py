"""Process-wide shared SessionDB registry.

Each bare ``SessionDB()`` mints its own writer connection, lock, close-time WAL checkpoint
and token writer thread, and one connection's close-time checkpoint can race another's
growth (lost/reordered-page-write corruption). This module owns that boundary: one shared
``SessionDB`` per resolved path per process, refcounted, with generation-aware retirement
when the file is replaced (snapshot restore, recovery swap).

Lifecycle rules:
- ``acquire(path)`` returns the current generation for *path* and bumps its refcount.
- ``close()`` on a shared instance RELEASES one refcount instead of tearing the
  connection down: the registry owns the physical lifecycle and only closes on the
  final release, so legacy call sites return their reference instead of leaking it.
- ``release(db)`` decrements the generation *db was acquired from* (object-keyed, so an
  inode replacement cannot strand a still-owned generation); the final release of a
  retired generation tears it down.
- On inode change the old generation is RETIRED (never lent again) but stays alive until
  its holders release. If the replacement open fails the registry keeps NO path entry.
- All teardown happens OUTSIDE the registry lock: a final release's WAL checkpoint must
  never stall acquisition for every state.db.
- A final close/checkpoint is serialized with the next open for the same path; no new
  generation is published while the previous generation is still tearing down.
- A path can have SEVERAL closes admitted at once (the current generation's final release
  plus a retired generation's drain). The path barrier COUNTS them and is lifted only by
  the last one to settle, so neither ``acquire`` nor ``close_all`` / ``close_all_under``
  can escape while any handle for that path is still inside checkpoint/WAL-unlink.
- Maintenance callers borrow handles with a temporary registry reference instead of
  iterating an unpinned snapshot.
