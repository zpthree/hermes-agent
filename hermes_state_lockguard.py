"""Hold a state.db writer's WAL-mode file locks in a form a stray ``close()`` cannot cancel.

SQLite protects a live WAL generation with two POSIX advisory locks: a SHARED lock on the main
file's lock range and a shared lock on the DMS byte of ``state.db-shm``. A sibling process may
checkpoint and unlink ``-wal``/``-shm`` at its close only after taking both EXCLUSIVE. POSIX locks
are per process, so any ``open()``/``close()`` of those two files inside the holder — a raw probe,
a plugin, a tool reading ``~/.hermes`` — cancels both (sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.html §2.2) and the
next foreign close strands the holder on a deleted generation (``DeletedWalGenerationError``).

This module adds the same two ranges as *open file description* locks (``F_OFD_SETLK``) on the
descriptors SQLite itself holds. OFD locks belong to the description, not the process: a stray
``close()`` elsewhere cannot cancel them, they die with the connection's own descriptor (nothing
extra to track or retire), and they conflict with a foreign EXCLUSIVE exactly like SQLite's own,
so the sibling's close-time unlink is refused while a guarded handle is open. The guard is
lifted before the handle's own close so a true last close still ends the generation normally.
No-op on Windows and on runtimes without OFD locks.

Ownership model: the guard is a property of the *descriptor*, and a descriptor number is
reusable. Each ``hold()`` therefore locks every matching descriptor unconditionally (an OFD
re-lock on an already-locked description is idempotent) and ``release()`` unlocks only while
another handle in this process still needs the range — tracked by handle count per INODE, not
per fd, so a recycled fd number can never be mistaken for a surviving lock.
