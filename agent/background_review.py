"""Background memory/skill review — fork the agent to evaluate the turn. After every turn
``AIAgent.run_conversation`` may spawn a daemon thread that replays the conversation snapshot in a

    "an existing class-level skill does, patch it. Add a subsection, a pitfall, or broaden a "
    "trigger.\n"
    "  3. ADD A SUPPORT FILE under an existing umbrella. Skills can be packaged with three kinds "
    "of support files — use the right directory per kind:\n"
    "     • `references/<topic>.md` — topical depth needed only sometimes: a decision table, a "
    "reproduction recipe, provider quirks, condensed domain notes or API excerpts. Name it by "
    "TOPIC and extend an existing file when one covers the topic; do not create a per-session or "
    "per-incident file, and do not paste error transcripts — distill them to the rule.\n"
    "     • `templates/<name>.<ext>` — starter files meant to be copied and modified (boilerplate "
    "configs, scaffolding, a known-good example the agent can `reproduce with modifications`).\n"
    "     • `scripts/<name>.<ext>` — statically re-runnable actions the skill can invoke directly "
    "(verification scripts, fixture generators, deterministic probes, anything the agent should "
    "run rather than hand-type each time).\n"
    "     Add support files via skill_manage action=write_file with file_path starting "
    "'references/', 'templates/', or 'scripts/'. The umbrella's SKILL.md should gain a one-line "
    "pointer to any new support file so future agents know it exists.\n"
    "  4. CREATE A NEW CLASS-LEVEL UMBRELLA SKILL when no existing skill covers the class. The "
    "name MUST be at the class level. The name MUST NOT be a specific PR number, error string, "
    "feature codename, library-alone name, or 'fix-X / debug-Y / audit-Z-today' session artifact. "
    "If the proposed name only makes sense for today's task, it's wrong — fall back to (1), (2), "
    "or (3).\n\n"
    "Read-before-write (ENFORCED — skill_manage refuses otherwise): before you patch or edit an "
    "existing skill's SKILL.md, call skill_view(name) for that skill during this review. Before "
    "you overwrite or remove an EXISTING supporting file, call skill_view(name, file_path=...) for "
    "that exact file. Content quoted earlier in the conversation transcript does NOT count — the "
    "guard requires a fresh load within this review, and your write must be based on what "
    "skill_view just returned. Creating a brand-new skill or adding a NEW supporting file needs no "
    "prior read. If a write is refused with a read-before-write error, call skill_view for the "
    "named target once and retry the write once; do not loop.\n\n"
    "User-preference embedding (important): when the user expressed a style/format/workflow "
    "preference, the update belongs in the SKILL.md body, not just in memory. Memory captures 'who "
    "the user is and what the current situation and state of your operations are'; skills capture "
    "'how to do this class of task for this user'. When they complain about how you handled a "
    "task, the skill that governs that task needs to carry the lesson.\n\n"
    "If you notice two existing skills that overlap, note it in your reply — the background "
    "curator handles consolidation at scale.\n\n"
    "Protected skills (DO NOT edit these):\n"
    "  • Bundled skills (shipped with Hermes, e.g. 'hermes-agent').\n"
    "  • Hub-installed skills (installed via 'hermes skills install').\n"
    "  • Skills in skills.external_dirs (externally owned).\n"
    "  • PINNED skills (marked via 'hermes curator pin'). You are an autonomous no-user-present "
    "actor, so pin blocks your writes too — content updates included. Only the user, in a "
    "foreground session, can change a pinned skill.\n"
    "  • USER-OWNED skills — anything not curator-managed. A skill the user hand-wrote, installed "
    "by URL, or asked a foreground agent to create is theirs, not yours; your writes to it WILL be "
    "refused. This includes skills that were loaded or consulted this session: being in play does "
    "not make one yours to edit. If such a skill is wrong or outdated, say so in your reply and "
    "recommend 'hermes curator adopt <name>' — do not try to patch it.\n"
    "If the only skills that need updating are protected, say\n"
    "'Nothing to save.' and stop.\n\n"
    "Do NOT capture" + _DO_NOT_CAPTURE_BLOCK +
    "'Nothing to save.' is a real option but should NOT be the default. If the session ran "
    "smoothly with no corrections and produced no new technique, just say 'Nothing to save.' and "

    "outcome.\n\n"
    "Target shape of the skill library: CLASS-LEVEL skills with a SKILL.md of always-on rules and a "
    "small `references/` set of topical depth — not narrow one-session skills, and not an umbrella "
    "hoarding a references/ file per session.\n\n" + _LESSON_LAYER_BLOCK +
    "Signals that warrant a skill update (any one is enough):\n"
    "  • User corrected your style, tone, format, legibility, verbosity, or approach. Frustration "
    "is a FIRST-CLASS skill signal, not just a memory signal. 'stop doing X', 'don't format like "
    "this', 'I hate when you Y' — embed the lesson in the skill that governs that task so the next "
    "session starts fixed.\n"
    "  • Non-trivial technique, fix, workaround, or debugging path emerged.\n"
    "  • A skill that was loaded or consulted turned out wrong, missing, or outdated — patch it "
    "now.\n\n"
    "Preference order for skills — pick the earliest that fits:\n"
    "  1. UPDATE A CURRENTLY-LOADED SKILL. Check what skills were loaded via /skill-name or "
    "skill_view in the conversation. If one of them covers the learning, PATCH it first (re-load "
    "it with skill_view during this review — see Read-before-write below). It was in play; it's "
    "the right place — provided it is curator-managed. Protected and user-owned skills are "
    "off-limits however relevant; fall through when one of those is the best fit.\n"
    "  2. UPDATE AN EXISTING UMBRELLA (skills_list + skill_view to find the right one). Patch it.\n"
    "  3. ADD A SUPPORT FILE under an existing umbrella via skill_manage action=write_file. Three "
    "kinds: `references/<topic>.md` for topical depth (decision tables, recipes, quirks, condensed "
    "domain notes) — extend an existing topical file before creating one, never a per-session file; "
    "`templates/<name>.<ext>` for starter files meant to be copied and modified; "
    "`scripts/<name>.<ext>` for statically re-runnable actions (verification, fixture generators, "
    "probes). Add a one-line pointer in SKILL.md so future agents find them.\n"
    "  4. CREATE A NEW CLASS-LEVEL UMBRELLA when nothing exists. Name at the class level — NOT a "
    "PR number, error string, codename, library-alone name, or 'fix-X / debug-Y' session artifact. "
    "If the name only fits today's task, fall back to (1), (2), or (3).\n\n"
    "Read-before-write (ENFORCED — skill_manage refuses otherwise): before patching or editing an "
    "existing skill's SKILL.md, call skill_view(name) during this review; before overwriting or "
    "removing an EXISTING supporting file, call skill_view(name, file_path=...) for that exact "
    "file. Content quoted earlier in the transcript does NOT count — base the write on what "
    "skill_view just returned. New skills and NEW supporting files need no prior read. On a "
    "read-before-write refusal: view the named target once, retry the write once, do not loop.\n\n"
    "User-preference embedding: when the user complains about how you handled a task, update the "
    "skill that governs that task rather than memory. Memory says 'who the user is and "
    "what the current situation and state of your operations are'; skills say 'how to do this "
    "class of task for this user'. A user-preference lesson lives in exactly ONE place: the skill "
    "that governs the task when one exists, USER.md only for cross-cutting preferences no skill "
    "owns — never both. Duplicating it is how a memory file ends up restating SKILL.md until both "
    "hit their size limits.\n\n"
    "If you notice overlapping existing skills, mention it — the background curator handles "
    "consolidation.\n\n"
    "Protected skills (DO NOT edit these):\n"
    "  • Bundled skills (shipped with Hermes, e.g. 'hermes-agent').\n"
    "  • Hub-installed skills (installed via 'hermes skills install').\n"
    "  • Skills in skills.external_dirs (externally owned).\n"
    "  • PINNED skills (marked via 'hermes curator pin'). Pin blocks autonomous writes entirely — "
    "content updates included — because no user is present to consent. Only a foreground session "
    "can change one.\n"
    "  • USER-OWNED skills — anything not curator-managed (hand-written, URL-installed, or created "
    "by a foreground agent at the user's request). Your writes to these WILL be refused, including "
    "to skills loaded or consulted this session. If one is wrong, say so in your reply and "
    "recommend 'hermes curator adopt <name>' instead.\n"
