"""Canonical reasoning-effort vocabulary and wire clamping.

Hermes' internal effort ladder (``VALID_REASONING_EFFORTS`` plus ``none``) is wider than any
single provider wire accepts; hand-rolled per-transport maps leaked new levels (``ultra``) to
wires that 400 and inverted the ladder (unknown → weak default). Single source of truth:
:data:`EFFORT_LADDER` (low→high), :func:`clamp_effort` (verbatim if supported, else the
nearest WEAKER level; only when nothing weaker exists the weakest supported), and named
wire-vocabulary constants so call sites declare data. Rules: wire shape stays local, only the
vocabulary math lives here; unset stays unset (never invent an effort); when a provider
rejects a level fix its declared set, never a predicate.
