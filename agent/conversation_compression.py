Thread-safety contract for extension points: with ``compression.context_timeout_seconds > 0`` (default) the
whole pass, context engines and memory providers included, runs on a pooled daemon thread. Calls may arrive
on any pooled thread (never rely on thread-affinity/locals); the message list is a private deep snapshot

# cancellation consult reads None. Both are fixed with a monotonic per-compressor attempt generation,
# claimed under one module lock. Restores and callback set/clear are keyed to the claiming generation and

    ``/compact <focus>``. force: If True, bypass any active summary-failure cooldown. Set by the manual
    ``/compress`` slash command so users can retry immediately after an auto-compress abort. Auto-compress
    callers use the default ``False``. bypass_cooldown: If True, the automatic breaker gates ignore ONLY the
    summary-failure cooldown for this attempt (#100661). Set by the provider-proven overflow recovery path:
    the provider already rejected the request, so deferring until the cooldown lapses wedges the session.
    Unlike ``force`` it does not clear the cooldown, and the ineffective/structural breakers still apply; a

    cooperative fence for executor callers that may time out. It prevents a late worker from mutating
    session state after its caller has moved on. verbatim_tail: The exchanges ``/compress here N`` keeps
    after ``messages``; an in-place commit stores them after the compacted head and returns head + tail.
