"""Surface switch without a prompt rebuild (#104414).

A surface switch (desktop <-> TUI, a session resumed under a different host) changes only which
interface renders the reply, but the surface guidance and the ``Platform:`` trailer are embedded
in the persisted system prompt.  Rebuilding for it diverged the prompt within its first blocks,
so the ENTIRE request behind it re-prefilled — a 220K-token session came back at a 1% cache hit.
The stored bytes are therefore kept and the CURRENT surface's guidance is delivered on the
per-turn user-message channel instead: that lands after the cached prefix and is stamped into
the byte-stable ``api_content`` sidecar so later turns replay it unchanged.  The prompt itself
converges at the next rebuild boundary (compaction).
