    reuse it as this turn's user dict and the flush writes no second row. What differs per lane is only HOW

    The DM is not always the literal tail: a turn that died mid-way persisted its tool scaffolding — assistant
    ``tool_calls`` rows and their ``tool`` results — behind the DM before the failure text was built, and the
    dispatcher retries that too. The DM is still unanswered while nothing after it is a plain assistant reply,
    so it is adopted and the failed attempt's scaffolding leaves the in-memory transcript: the re-run starts
    the turn over from the DM (the rows stay in the DB as the record of the failed attempt; the re-run's
