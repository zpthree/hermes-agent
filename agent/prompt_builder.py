    "primary coordination surface — they write directly to the shared SQLite DB and work regardless of terminal "
    "backend (local/docker/modal/ssh).\n"
    "\n"
    "## Lifecycle\n\n"
    "1. **Orient.** Call `kanban_show()` first (no args — it defaults to your task). The response includes title, "
    "body, parent-task handoffs (summary + metadata), any prior attempts on this task if you're a retry, the full "
    "comment thread, and a pre-formatted `worker_context` you can treat as ground truth.\n"
    "2. **Work inside the workspace.** `cd $HERMES_KANBAN_WORKSPACE` before any file operations. The workspace is "
    "yours for this run. Don't modify files outside it unless the task explicitly asks.\n"
    "3. **Heartbeat on long operations.** Call `kanban_heartbeat(note=...)` every few minutes during long subprocesses "
    "(training, encoding, crawling). Skip heartbeats for short tasks. **If your task may run longer than 1 hour, you "
    "MUST call `kanban_heartbeat` at least once an hour** — the dispatcher reclaims tasks running past "
    "`kanban.dispatch_stale_timeout_seconds` (default 4 hours) when no heartbeat has arrived in the last hour. A "
    "reclaim re-queues the task as `ready` without penalty (no failure counter tick), but you lose your current run's "
    "progress.\n"
    "4. **Block on genuine ambiguity.** If you need a human decision you cannot infer (missing credentials, UX choice, "
    "paywalled source, peer output you need first), call `kanban_block(reason=\"...\")` and stop. Don't guess. The "
    "user will unblock with context and the dispatcher will respawn you.\n"
    "5. **Finish with the review model encoded by the task graph.** Always include the structured handoff (`summary`, "
    "`metadata`) on the lifecycle transition itself; never put secrets, tokens, or raw PII in these durable fields. If "
    "`kanban_show()` lists child IDs, inspect those cards with `kanban_show(task_id=...)` before choosing the terminal "
    "action. When any pre-created review, QA, or release child depends on your task, call `kanban_complete`: your "
    "implementation phase is done, and completion is what releases those children. Never sticky-block that parent for "
    "`review-required` and never request same-card review as well — either choice would strand or duplicate the "
    "downstream lane. Otherwise, when this same task needs review before it is final, call "
    "`kanban_request_review(summary=..., metadata=..., reviewer=<optional-profile>)`. The reviewer approves with "
    "`kanban_complete`, returns actionable rework with `kanban_request_changes`, or uses `kanban_block` only for a "
    "genuine external escalation. Review is not a block, so repeated review cycles do not trip unblock-loop "

    "or a file your diff touches shows up in other cards' recent comments, do not silently add more to it: leave a "
    "`kanban_comment` starting with `hotspot: <path> — <one-line reason>` on your card and repeat the flag in your "

# issues one tool call per turn multiplies the number of round-trips — and therefore the resent context —

# into a single assistant response collapses N turns into one, cutting both latency and the resent-context
# cost that compounds over a long conversation. The hermes-agent runtime already executes a batch of tool
# calls concurrently when they are independent (read-only tools always; path-scoped file ops when their
# targets don't overlap — see run_agent._execute_tool_calls / tool_dispatch_helpers). The missing piece was

# the prompt lived in GOOGLE_MODEL_OPERATIONAL_GUIDANCE — Gemini/Gemma got it, every other model got
# nothing. Short on purpose — shipped in the cached system prompt to every user, every session. Token cost

# Execution-discipline guidance for models that abandon partial results, skip prerequisite lookups, answer

# Injection gate: system_prompt.py via config.yaml ``agent.execution_guidance`` (auto/true/false/list).
# OpenAI GPT/Codex-specific execution guidance. Addresses known failure modes where GPT models abandon work
# on partial results, skip prerequisite lookups, hallucinate instead of using tools, and declare "done"
# without verification. Inspired by patterns from OpenAI's GPT-5.4 prompting guide & OpenClaw PR #38953.
# Also applied to xAI Grok — same failure modes in practice (claims completion without tool calls, suggests
# workarounds instead of using existing tools, replies with plans/suggestions instead of executing). As of
# the Composio agentic-eval follow-up, the block is no longer fenced to gpt/codex/grok: eval traces showed
# DeepSeek/Kimi doing financial math in prose, skipping read-back verification after external writes,
# "repairing" malformed identifiers, and claiming completeness despite count mismatches — exactly the
# failure modes this block targets.
