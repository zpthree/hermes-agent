# call per compaction). The main-model retry must NOT re-issue the pin.
# ── Pinned summary route ───────────────────────────────────────────────── The summary call normally
# resolves its provider/model from ``auxiliary.compression``. One caller needs to override that for a single

# ``agent.conversation_compression`` re-runs compression with the route pinned to a configured
# ``fallback_chain`` entry. Nothing raised out of the stalled call, so the auxiliary client's own fallback
# handling — which only runs from its exception path — never saw that failure. A ContextVar, not an
# attribute on the compressor: the aborted worker is detached and still alive on the pool, and the
# compressor object is shared with it. Context is copied per worker (``propagate_context_to_thread``), so
# the pin reaches the retry's whole synchronous call chain and cannot leak into the stalled attempt or any
# unrelated auxiliary call. Coverage is the single ``_generate_summary`` LLM call only. That is one call per
# compression run (its only non-recursive call site is the compress path; the two recursive calls are the
# deliberate main-model retry that must NOT re-issue the pin). The summary call is the ONLY auxiliary LLM

        keeps the newest full copy and back-references older exact duplicates ANYWHERE in the list

        results larger than ``min_prune_chars``; (3) truncate oversized tool_call arguments on non-tail
        assistant messages; (3.5) retire image payloads on all but the newest ``_MAX_KEEP_TOOL_IMAGES``
        image-bearing tool results — tail-agnostic and lossy by design (#92699). Only pass (2)'s floor is
        raised by ``proactive_prune_min_result_chars``; passes (1) and (3) keep their own fixed floors. The
        recent-tail protection applies to passes (2) and (3); pass (1) is tail-agnostic by design because

## Goal
Recovered from a deterministic fallback because the LLM context summarizer was unavailable. Continue from the protected recent messages after this summary and use current file/system state for exact details.{previous_summary_note}

## Constraints & Preferences
- This fallback was generated locally without an LLM summary call.
- Secrets and credentials were redacted before preservation.
- The summary may be incomplete; prefer verifying current files, git state, processes, and test results instead of assuming omitted details.

## Completed Actions
{chr(10).join(completed) if completed else "None recoverable from compacted turns."}

## Active State
Unknown from deterministic fallback. Inspect current repository/session state if needed.

## Blocked
{_bullets(anchors["blockers"], limit=5)}

## Key Decisions
None recoverable from deterministic fallback.

## Resolved Questions
None recoverable from deterministic fallback.

## Relevant Files
{_bullets(anchors["relevant_files"], limit=12)}

## Last Dropped Turns
{_bullets(anchors["last_dropped_turns"], limit=8)}

## Critical Context
Summary generation was unavailable, so this is a best-effort deterministic fallback for {len(turns_to_summarize)} compacted message(s).{reason_text}"""

## Constraints & Preferences
{_section["constraints"]}

## Completed Actions
[Numbered list of concrete actions taken — include tool used, target, and outcome.
Format each as: N. ACTION target — outcome [tool: name]
Example:
1. READ config.py:45 — found `==` should be `!=` [tool: read_file]
2. PATCH config.py:45 — changed `==` to `!=` [tool: patch]
3. TEST `pytest tests/` — 3/50 failed: test_parse, test_validate, test_edge [tool: terminal]
Be specific with file paths, commands, line numbers, and results.]

## Active State
[Current working state — include:
- Working directory and branch (if applicable)
- Modified/created files with brief note on each
- Test status (X/Y passing)
- Any running processes or servers
- Environment details that matter]

## Blocked
[Any blockers, errors, or issues not yet resolved. Include exact error messages.]

## Key Decisions
[Important technical decisions and WHY they were made]

## Errors & Fixes
[Errors hit during the compacted turns and how each was resolved — include the
exact error text. Pay special attention to corrections the USER gave; quote
the user's correction and record what changed as a result.]

## Resolved Questions
{_section["resolved_questions"]}

## Relevant Files
[Files read, modified, or created — with brief note on each]

## Critical Context
[Any specific values, error messages, configuration details, or data that would be lost without explicit preservation. NEVER include API keys, tokens, passwords, or credentials — write [REDACTED] instead.]{_session_log_section}

use. If none appear, omit this section entirely.]

Target ~{summary_budget + (_LEAN_SESSION_LOG_BUDGET_TOKENS if _session_log_section else 0)} tokens. Be CONCRETE — include file paths, command outputs, error messages, line numbers, and specific values. Avoid vague descriptions like "made some changes" — say exactly what changed.
