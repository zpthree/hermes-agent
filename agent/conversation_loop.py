"""The agent conversation loop — extracted from ``run_agent.AIAgent``.

``run_conversation(agent, ...)`` drives one user turn (model call, tool dispatch,
retries, fallbacks, compression, post-turn hooks). Symbols that callers patch on
``run_agent`` (``handle_function_call``, ``_set_interrupt``, ``OpenAI``) resolve via
``_ra`` so those patches keep working."""
