# Privacy filter (moa.privacy_filter: '' | display | full): PII classes agent.redact
# leaves alone. The phone pattern requires explicit delimiters so line numbers,
# dates, times, SHAs, IPs and versions never match.
# Advisor (reference) outputs can echo PII from the conversation — emails, phone numbers, credentials pasted
# by the user — into surfaces the user may not expect: the labelled reference blocks rendered in the UI,
# saved MoA trace files, and (in `full` mode) the guidance block injected into the aggregator prompt (issue
# #59959). Secret/credential shapes (API-key prefixes, JWTs, private keys, DB connection strings, E.164
# phone numbers) are handled by the repo's central redactor, ``agent.redact .redact_sensitive_text`` — the
# MoA filter never re-implements those. The two patterns below cover the PII classes the central redactor
# deliberately leaves alone for log/tool output (emails and formatted phone numbers). Pattern safety:
# advisory text is frequently code-review-shaped — line numbers, timestamps, git SHAs, IDs, IP addresses. A
# bare 10-digit match would mangle all of those, so the phone pattern requires clearly delimited formatting:
# a parenthesized area code and/or explicit `-`/`.` separators between groups ((555) 123-4567, 555-123-4567,
# 555.123.4567, +1 555-123-4567). Undelimited digit runs (5551234567), dates (2026-07-12), times (12:34:56),
# hex IDs, and dotted quads never match. International numbers in E.164 form (+14155551234) are already
