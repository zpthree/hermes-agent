"""Pre-API preflight compression gate and post-tool compression for the turn loop.

Runs once per API call after the request pressure is measured: grow a managed llama.cpp

failure cooldown, or while the review fork's first request is pending), handle the
provider-proven overflow re-check fail-closed, and emit the deduped blocked/uncompressed
